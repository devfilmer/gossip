There are people who believe that racism doesn't exist in America.  It's a dangerous narrative that is being propagated by individuals who either have their own private agendas or who are oblivious to their surrondings.   Sadly, many minorities continue to experience unprecedented racism in their daily lives.  It's an unfortunate fact.  And for those who think they can run from it or hide from it... those are the ones that find themselves becoming victims.  How so?  They become people who are not given equal opportunities.  They become people who are held to a higher standard for lower wages.  They become people who are never aloud to reach their full potential.  They become people who are simply not treated fairly just because they were born minorities.  And for this reason, it must be applauded when they stand up for themselves.  Such is the case with a woman named <a href = "https://www.tiktok.com/@taila.thecreator/video/7237649737305050414?%3B_t=8cfOnxWHu3y&_r=1">Taila Rouse</a>.  <br><br>

While travelling from Puerto Rico to Atlanta, she allegedly encountered a person who was posting racist and derogatory texts on their phone.  Most may have just ignored the person.  Some may have actually asked to sit somewhere else.  But Ms. Rouse met decided to confront the person and call them out in front of everyone.  In addition she recorded the incident on Tic Tok for 15 million to see.  However you look at her actions, there is no way you can get around her bravery.  How many people do you know could actually do what she did? <br><br>

The sad story is that while some may want to claim this is an isolated incident and sweep it under the road, the truth is that American society is becoming inherently more prejudice.  The polarization of the citizens is becoming clear in the areas of law enforcement, politics, and the workplace.  It's being taught and unfortunately accepted which is institutionalizing the practice of racism by average everyday Americans of all ages and ethnicities.  And to what end?  The last thing America needs to be right now is divided.
