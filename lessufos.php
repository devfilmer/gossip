		17 April, 2020<br><br>

		Has anyone out there noticed something terribly conspicuous about the news lately?  When you watch the media everyday, you begin to see how they recycle stories over and over.  You're not going to go a week without seeing something about the Kardashians.  You can't go a month without a sprinkle of Ellen or Oprah.  You have to have a little Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt in there too.  And when it come to recurring themes, you're going to hear about Trump's latest fopah, Putin's popularity, Royal Family Drama in the UK, problems in the Middle East, violence in Africa, drugs in South America, climate change, and UFO sightings.  Wait a minute, what happened to the UFOs?  When was the last time you saw an article talking about shimmering lights in the sky near an Air Force Base?  When was the last time you heard someone disclose that they believe they were abducted by Aliens?  I don't even think I've seen the old Ancient Aliens rebroadcasts on TV lately.  <br><br>
		
		You know what?  Ever since the Coronavirus, you don't hear a damn thing about no aliens.  It's almost like folks either realized that the whole Alien thing was bull or that the Coronavirus is too serious for us to be talking about Aliens anymore.  Shoot, we're hanging out to watch Goveror Cuomo tell us the status of New York's pandemic response now . Who wants to hear about the latest Alien bull crap sighting?   No one can go to a restaurant to sit and eat.  The movie theaters are closed.  The governing officials are struggling to deal with a worldwide coronavirus pandemic.  No one has time for Aliens.  Right?  <br><br>

		Wrong. Hold your horses.  We're not going to stand by and let this Alien thing go unchecked, even in the midst of the pandemic.  Let's see what they've been up to.  Below, you can see a chart that shows the number of sightings by month overlapped graphically with each year since 2016.  Data for this chart comes from the <a href="http://nuforc.org">National UFO Reporting Center</a>. In red, you see that we are only in month April of 2020 so the data doesn't extend to December.  What's interesting is how there's never been a single year in the past 5 years where the number of sightings decreased as the year went along.  Since 2016, the number of sightings has always gone up... until now!<br><br>

		Maybe, people have something more to worry about other than UFOs at the moment.  Or could it be something else?  Maybe the aliens were scoping us out and saw we had screwed up the planet and so they left.  Maybe they realized that climate change was going to make the planet uninhabitable.  Maybe they released the coronavirus and left.  Maybe they just got sick and tired of all the bull shit, packed up all their mind control equipment, put away their laser guns and left.  One thing is for sure, folks aren't reporting as many UFO sightings.... And that has to mean something.<br><br>
