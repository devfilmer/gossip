I'm not sure why everyone seems to be so relaxed about what's going on in the Ukraine.  Thousands of soldiers are now in the region which has already become a combat zone.  It's as if few of us comprehend the seriousness of the matter.  To really get a clear understanding of how bad this conflict already is, we don't have to go back in history too far.  We only have to look back just a little ways.  When the United States deployed troops to Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Kuwait to restore peace in the Persian Gulf, some 500,000 soldier, sailor, and airmen were sent.  It was the largest deployment of troops since the Vietnam War where the United states deployed some 543,000 troops.

   </p><br><br>
		Understanding these numbers, it is clear that for Russia to deply some 190,000 troops to the borders of the Ukraine is a serious matter.  It is a message to the world that they will not accept any interference in this matter and that attempts to aid the Ukraine will be met with war. <br><br>
		
   <p>

   </p><br><br>
So, what does the United States do in a situation like this.  So far, the response has been light, calculated, and clever.  However, a withdrawal by the Russians has not occurred and tensions in the region continue to mount as shelling begins to increase on both sides.  To many soldiers with too many weapons in close proximity with too many leaders not negotiating equals casualties.  The more casualties, the more likely an all out confrontation could come to pass... one where an invasion of the Ukraine is imminent.  This act could throw the entire European continent into a state of unrest and ultimately bring the U.S. to the brink of war.  <br><br>

   </p><br><br>
There is still time for peace.  I fear it will require more than just our leaders to bail us out of imminent conflict.  It will require the people to rise up and confront their leadership with the clear and pointed message that War is not an option... that peace is what the people desire and that anything else is unacceptable.  Today's weapons are too powerful.  The loss of life that will come will be horrific and all for what.... hundreds of acres of land soiled by human blood for a cause that no one will remember and a conflict that no one understands.
