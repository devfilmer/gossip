No one really wants to talk about it but we all know we have to talk about it.  I'm talking about Mr. Putin's statements which have been acknowledged and understood that he is willing to consider the usage of Nuclear Weapons in the conflict with the Ukraine.  It's a statement that should never have been uttered.  It's a thought that should never be considered.  Enough blood shed has taken place and even Russians are attempting to leave their homeland.  The Russian-Ukrainian conflict has taken a catestrophic toll on both countries and has destabilized the world as a whole economically, socially, and politically.  
<br><br>


The thing that should be our greatest concern is that if a nuclear weapon is used during this conflict, what could potentially happen to countries who have tried to stay out of it.  We are all inextricably tied to a single planet where a decision of this magnitude could have global implications.  Now the truth is, when America released Atom bombs on Japan in World War II, this was a use of nuclear weapons.  <a href =" https://www.lanl.gov/museum/discover/_docs/atomic-vs-nuclear-weapons.pdf">Atom Bombs are nuclear weapons. </a>  And it is a known fact that the detonation of nuclear weapons can immediately kill every living thing within 15 miles while causing horrible ailments to people within 53 miles.... <a href = "https://www.businessinsider.com/nuclear-bomb-attack-russia-ukraine-how-strong-far-2022-2#:~:text=A%201%2C000%2Dkiloton%20nuclear%20blast,could%20also%20experience%20temporary%20blindness.">And that was way back then.</a>  <br>

   </p>
		
		What could happen now that weapons are between 20 to 30 times more devastating?  Countries immediately to the east of Ukraine, places like Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, and India could be effected by nuclear fall out immediately <a href="https://aptv.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/buac17-68-sci-ess-nasajetstream/jet-streams/">simply because of the flow of the jet stream.</a>  And yet, everyone is just going through the motions, not believing that Mr. Putin just might do it... And if it happens, it could be worse than Hiroshima... worse than Nagasaki... Russia is not the only country with nuclear weapons in the region.  This could be the start of a chain reaction of attacks using nuclear weapons simply because Mr. Putin decided he would impose his will on the Ukraine and they chose to resist.  It's unfortunate that countries on the sidelines will be effected and possibly thrust into a conflict they wanted nothing to do with...<br><br>

I certainly hope that the whole of Russia realizes that nuclear weapons in this day and age don't resolve conflicts... they destabilize civilization itself and therefore are not a viable solution to maintaining global peace.
