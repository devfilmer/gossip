I'm having a hard time accepting all the terrible news coming over the air these days.  It's January, 23, 2020 and I just learned that Krystal is filing for bankruptcy.  I'm not going to lie.  This brought me to tears.  I found myself laying in my bed looking at the ceiling wondering WTF?  I have so many fond memories of Krystal tied to my childhood.  In my youth, it would be a kids dream to go to Toys R Us, and on your way, you might stop at Krystals.  If you were lucky, you'd have to stop for gas at U-tote-M.  Then you could get one of those coldest drinks in town while the car was being filled with gas.  Of course, you'd get to the mall and walk every floor until you arrived at the ultimate destination, Toys R Us, and look at all the wonderful toys that were too damn expensive for you to have unless it was soon to be your birthday or Christmas... But alas, soon it was time to leave.  Then as you sauntered past all the clothing stores desperately waiting to leave, you might stop by the food court.  But nope, not this time, dad was ready to go...  Ready to go where?  Too Krystal... That's right, the home of the perfectly square delectable sin filled with onions and pickles... 
		
		
		<br><br>

Everything about Krystal was perfect.  There I said it.  They have the perfect nasty little sandwich packaged with bright red and white colors.  The store is perfectly painted to lure you in and all the menu items are perfectly named.  Krystal burger.  Krystal Chick.  Krystal This.  Krystal That.  Give me the shake.  Yes I want the fries.  Yes I want cheese and bacon and ketchup and yes I want a dozen of them.  No, I want two dozen of them.  No, I don't want to share.  You have to get your own.  Oh goodness, I've got mine.  Do you have yours?  I can't wait for you to get yours.  I'm sitting down and I'm going to eat mine while there hot.  The perfect slider with the perfect bun with onions, pickles, bacon, mustard, ketchup, and cheese.  That's how I like mine.  One bite.  Two bites... Three, it's gone.  Give me another one.  One bite, two bites, three, it's gone.  Give me another, and another, and another.  Don't let it end.  Another, another, and another.  I'm getting full.  I'm getting happy.  Give me my vanilla shake.  Oh my goodness, I just woke up....  <br><br>


I don't understand.  I was having the perfect dream.  I remember after going to Krystal, there would often be a chance to stop by K-mart and possibly get some cheap toy since you didn't get anything at Toys R Us.  Oh well... Now it's all over.  There's no U-tote-M.  There's no Toys R Us... There's no K-Mart... and now there's no Krystal? I hear they are restructuring.  I hear that no store closings have been announced.  Maybe there's a chance that just this one little thing to crush my spirit won't happen.  I want everybody to go out to Krystal and buy up everything.  Krystal must survive.  The perfect nasty little hamburger can not be allowed to die.  We should be protesting in the street.  We should be marching on Washington.  We must pledge ourselves to saving the only nasty little thing that you can eat that can make you smile.  Buy Krystals!  Buy Krystals! Buy Krystals!
