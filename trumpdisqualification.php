    <h1>It's Time For Americans To Realize That Mr. Trump May Be Disqualified As Candidate For President In 2024!</h1>
   <p>

   </p>
    <p style = "font-size:20px">

It's not a mystery to anyone who is paying attention to our current 2024 GOP candidates debating on the big stage about today's biggest issues, global conflict, and of course Mr. Donald J. Trump.  It must be terribly unconfortable to realize that no matter what Mr. Trump has done or the fact that he can't stay out of the court room, he doesn't even have to be on the debate stage to lead the 2024 GOP contenders by an incredible margin.. This fact alone speaks volumes to where the thinking of the American people really is.  For those who do not want to accept the truth, you can't ignore it.  You can't not see it.  It's in plain sight.  America has a Congress controlled by a Republican majority that could not elect a Speaker for 22 days.  Imagine that... America had an acting Speaker for 3 weeks.  Arguably the third most powerful person in the world... the job was filled by a substitue.  <br><br>

In addition to the fact that the Congress had trouble filling the Speaker vacancy, current legislation featuring flashy sound bites and ridiculous bills has been the norm.  So what happens if the current moves against Trump are successful and by some unsightly methods, Trump is disqualified as an acceptable candidate for President.  It's been stated several different ways on various networks.  For those who don't want to hear it again, leave now.  See the list below...<br><br>

<ul><h1>Two Ways Mr. Donald J. Trump Could Be Disqualified</h1>
   <li> Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of The United States </li>
   <li> Senate Impeachment Hearing regarding Mr. Trump's qualification to run for President. </li>
</ul><br><br>
 <img src="images/haleysmiling.png" />
<br><br>
Either way, there is a clear path to align the current court room hearings with voting primaries that will take place in early 2024.  This is by design.  Imagine, States will face whether they want to enact legislation that removes Mr. Trump as a viable candidate to consider in the primaries.  In addition, any conviction of Mr. Trump for an felony or felonies could end up as the basis for having a Senate hearing on Mr. Trump's eligibility.  And we've covered how the Senate and the Congress both have members who can't wait to take center stage.  They've already removed one elected official in Congress this year, Mr. Santos, who deserved it.... <br><br>
 <img src="images/theygotsantos.png" />
<br><br>

Why would anyone be surprised to hear the Senate disqualify Mr. Trump in his bid for the Presidency?  It's just another episode on the Senate Floor Reality TV series.  It most certainly will last three or more weeks... just like the Mr. Kevin McCarthy installement back in October of 2023.  So, after the "Mr. Trump Didn't Make It" series ends, what is America left with... That's right, Mr. Desantis, Ms. Nikki Haley, and the incomparable Mr. Chris Christie... 
<br><br>
 <img src="images/christiecaricature.png" />
<br><br>Oops, did we leave out Mr. Vivek Ramaswamy... yes we did.   One of these people could actually "end up" as President of the United States.  Sounds terrible right?  But the truth is no one else has stepped forward with a plan and thrown their hat in the ring.  So, these are the choices. <br><br>

Anyone who challenges Mr. Joe Biden as an alternative choice in the Democratic Party is counting on Mr. Biden either stepping down or not being capable of winning in the Democratic primaries... This is highly unlikely.  So it could turn out to be a contest between a handfull of 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place 2024 GOP wannabees and an aging Mr. Biden.  Sadly, it's happening at one of the most dangerous moments in world history... Russia on the war path.  Israel seeking retribution against Hamas, and a collapsing US economy.  If there is anyone else that thinks their up for the job and has a real plan for America... you're running out of time to throw your hat in the ring!

The Congress and the Senate should not be a place to promote oneself or ideologies that do not benefit Americans.  At the end of the day, the prosperity of the American people should be the focus of America\'s elected officials.  Ensuring the needs of the poor are tended to should be a priority.  Enabling the disenfranchised should be a priority.  Protecting the citizens from drugs, criminal activity, and poverty should be a priority.  The American People have some tough choices to make.  But if they can see past the sitcom, it\'s a clear choice.
