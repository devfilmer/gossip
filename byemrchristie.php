It’s unfortunate but it’s just how America plays the game.  We’ve aloud the media to dictate who will become arguably the most powerful person in the world.  The truth is I never really paid much attention to it before but now I can’t seem to stop looking at it.  What you might ask?  I’m talking about the major news outlets who are now controlling who gets to stand on the debate stage and plead their case to the American people as to why they are the best choice to lead the people.  Let me state that again for those who did not get it the first time.  The media is now setting the thresholds that determine who gets to be on the debate stage.  This is very important to note because there may have been candidates that were better suited to lead but did not get the chance to really demonstrate their capabilities.  You get a very short period in this game to show your hand and if the people miss it… you miss your chance.  The field of candidates for the 2024 GOP was pretty deep for a while.  It appeared at first to look like anyone who had a suit coat without a hole in it was running for president.  Now, it appears that all of a sudden there are only two candidates for president in the 2024 GOP.  Oops… did I say two?  Oh yeah, I forgot the front runner, Mr. Trump.  I guess I’ve already taken him out of contention.  That’s what the courts are trying to do.  I’m not sure how they (The Supreme Court) are going to stop them (The State Courts).  It’s almost like we’ve got too many intelligent people who know how to twist the words sprinkled within the laws of the land to their liking and wah la… Mr. Trump is no longer qualified to run even though he is leading the entire 2024 GOP bench by a margin that really  shows him as the victor… that is while he’s trying not to go to jail.

But let’s get back to the casualties if we can shall we.  Today, I think we should focus on poor Governor Chis Christie.  By the way… he was actually a great choice if you listen to him.  So was Senator Tim Scott for that matter.  I digress.  But they just picked him apart.  No one was listening.  He had some seriously bright moments.  My favorite was when he came to Nikki Haley’s defense when attacked by Mr. Vivek Ramaswamy.  There’s a lot of people who don’t like talking about this but the day Mr. Ramaswamy brought Nikki’s daughter into the narrative in my opinion was the end of his campaign.  That's another reason I said earlier we now only have two candidates (Nikki and Ron).  He was doing so well… sort of… but after that… Even telling Van Jones to “Shut The $#FR%E up” is not enough… Yeah, it’s time for him to go sit down some where and think about some of the things he has said that don’t make any sense.  Oh, someone is going to get mad because we were supposed to be talking about Governor Christie and now we’re bashing Ramaswamy… <br><br>
<img src="images/ramaswamy.png" style="display:none"/>

<br><br>Well, the rant was originally going to be directed at Governor Christie but in order to understand this discourse you have to go back to the Don Lemon interview with Mr. Ramaswamy.  This guy (Ramaswamy) knows nothing about American history.  And somehow, it cost Mr. Don Lemon his job.  Well, that and a few other things cost Mr. Lemon his job… but I think many would agree that was the last straw.  Mr. Ramaswamy demonstrated that if you talk fast enough, without taking a breath and look people straight in the eye, you can rewrite history and spin a narrative that people will have a hard time refuting.  When you hear him, it’s like a train blowing its whistle and no one can hear anything else.  And that is why the loss of Governor Christie in this race is such a shame.  He really was the only one that knew how to get around loud, obnoxious noise and continue to communicate.  We shouldn’t be surprised… He’s from New Jersey.  He was the Governor of New Jersey.   When he heard a blow hard, he pointed it out.  He called it what it was… Hot air.  with no hesitation and no apologies.  That’s the kind of toughness that the mainstream media is not focusing on.  They’d rather focus on the jokes about his weight or the ugliness that Ms Haley is having to endure… the mud slinging.  Several times, Governor Christie gave clear, concise, straight forward answers to tough debate questions while pointing out that his peers in the race were not answering the questions.  No one cared… The just fell asleep while he spoke and when they woke up.  CNN had eliminated him from contention… Sad.  Sad. Sad.  But True.  So long Mr. Christie.  Well, that is unless Ms. Haley makes you her VP.

I do not see this happening.  In all likelyhood, both of them will have their own choices for VP.  Truth is, I do not even know if its worth talking about because Mr. Trump is so far ahead, his bid for the Presidency can not be ignored.  If Mr. Trump does not get the nomination, he may be the first front runner in American history to lose his bid due to America\'s legal system.  Only time will tell.
