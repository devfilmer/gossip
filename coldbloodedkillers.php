		When I first heard about this story, I thought to myself, oh well, just another senseless, racist act of violence.... just another black man in the wrong place at the wrong time.... But then I looked a little closer, and the more I read, the more I looked, the more disgusted I became.  It's like why the hell did this happen?  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/ahmaud-arbery-killing-man-called-911-report-black-male-running-shooting">Apparently, two white men see a black man and decide that he is criminal...</a> They say they saw him in what they claim was a property that was wide open... Then, they pursue him... For what?  To question him?  To identify him?  Someone  even had the presence of mind to video the encounter... For what again I ask?  For proof of their attempt to stop a crime?  For looking at later, I don't know.  But somehow, someone had time to video the hunting of an unarmed black man who appears to be jogging in a neighborhood.  He doesn't appear to be running from anyone... <br><br>
		
		And then, the unthinkable happens... They claim that they just wanted to ask Ahmaud some questions and he apparently violently attacks one of them... <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/video-appears-show-georgia-man-shot-while-jogging-lawyers-call-n1201301">Well, the video doesn't appear to show the meet and greet between the individuals.</a> All I can see is two young men, one black and one white struggling to get a weapon that was brought by the "hunters", and an older white gentleman loading a weapon... Then you hear it, a single shot... end of the squabble, end of the questions, end of the hunt, the end of Ahmaud's jog and the end of his life.  I'm not going to sugar coat this.  It pisses me off every time I hear a story like this one.  It's the reason why America continues to circle endlessly in time without growing with regards to racial inequality, social equity, and cultural diversity.  It's the reason why Americans struggle to forge themselves as one people instead of a melting pot that won't blend.  Was Ahmaud a criminal?  Was he running from these two men?  Was he a threat to anyone?  Were there any other options?  Well, I can't answer all of these but I can sure as hell answer one.  There were other options.  They had a damn camera.  Why couldn't they shoot a few photos of him instead of shooting bullets?  Why could they not take the photos to the police and let them conduct a proper investigation?  Why did they feel it was necessary for them to take matters into their own hands with loaded weapons?  Why is there a video of the whole thing?  <br><br>
		
		You wanna know why, I'll tell you why?  Emmett Till, Rudy Bridges, Trayvon Martin, Michael Griffith, Willie Turks, Michael Donald, Willie James Howard, Slab Pitts, Mary Turner, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lynching_victims_in_the_United_States">and the list goes on...</a>  There appears to be an illness in a fraction of American society that perpetuates violence between cultures... between peoples.  And we need to recognize this for what it is... a mental illness that is instilled and developed generation after generation.  Call it what you want.  Hate... Racism... Violence... Social Unacceptance... Cultural Divide... I don't give damn.  Until America becomes one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all, we can't grow... We can't win... Because instead of building bridges, we keep blowing them up.  Instead of shaking hands, we're shooting at one another.  We are one people.... not four, not five, not six, not ten... just one.  Humanity has no color.  Justice has no color... and until we recognize that a a man shouldn't lose his life for jogging down street, folks, we got problems.  <br><br><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/biden-slams-arbery-shooting-grave-injustice-demands-investigation-n1202291">
		
		Mr. Joe Biden, thank you for saying what needed to be said right when it needed to be said.</a> R.I.P. Ahmaud Arbery, Justice Is On The Way!<br><br>
