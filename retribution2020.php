		Ok, so what is everyone so surprised about?  Less than 48 hours after President Trump was acquitted by the U.S. Senate from his impeachment, he begins purging those who spoke out against him.  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-fires-impeachment-witnesses-gordon-sondland-and-alexander-vindman-in-post-acquittal-purge/ar-BBZLUzc?li=BBnb7Kz">There are actually people shocked to hear that Gordon Sondland and Alexander Vindman have been released from their current high profile positions.</a>  Why is this so surprising?  Look, you can't expect to keep your job if you piss off the boss.  Oh, yeah, that's right, somehow you forgot the President of the United States is yo boss son... And on top of that, he doesn't like it when you talk back let alone if you speak out of turn... WTF did you think was going to happen if you tried to get him fired?  Man o man o man.   These folks are lucky they don't get an assignment cleaning up dog poop at a land fill.  <br><br>
		
		Can you imagine being President of the United States and someone pissed you off?  I couldn't believe Ms. Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of The House, who has consistently spoken out against the President and led the charge in Congress to publish two articles of impeachment against him actually offered to shake the President's hand at the State of the Union Address on national television.  Whether you support Trump or not, think about it.  If someone had turned their dogs loose on you and you barely got over the fence to save your hide, would you shake their hand at the neighborhood watch meeting?  Hell naw!<br><br>

		It's pretty simple really.  Once you've ruined your relationship with your boss, it's damn near impossible to fix it.  It's human nature.  There's no shortage of highly qualified people that can fill your shoes.  And once you piss off your boss, they don't want you there.  In their mind, they don't need you there.  You're a liability.  You're working against the common goal... the common good in their mind.  So, you gotta go.  You're the one that gets hurt.  And it don't matter if you're Mr. Sondland who gave 1 million dollars to President Trumps campaign before being named Ambassador to the European Union.  You're fired.  It don't matter if you're a decorated war hero like LTC Vindman, you said things that pissed off the boss.  You gotta go.   It don't matter if you're the Speaker of the House, the Chairman of the Board, the Head Chef at Tellini's, the owner of a fortune 500 company... you gots to go.  If I were Mr. George Kent, Laura Cooper, or David Holmes, I'd be looking for a job.  Anyone who participated in tarnishing the President, dude, it's just a matter of time... Mr. Trump don't play that.<br><br>
		
		And you got to ask yourself, if you were the boss, would you?
