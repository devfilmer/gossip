	I wonder if anyone is paying attention to what's going on with social security.  Since 2018, there have been numerous article written by various authors debating about the loss of benefits that will take place in 2023 and the eventual 20% reduction in benefits overall sometime around 2034/2035.. <a href ="https://www.fool.com/retirement/2020/09/14/could-social-security-out-money-pay-benefits-2023/">Read more here...</a>For members of this site with our platinum package, you can track see our social security countdown timer counting down to the year 2035.  It really bothers me when I hear people down play the social security benefit.  To me, it's more than that.  The majority of all the money I've made, like most Americans, had social security installments taken out of the pay.  It wasn't optional.  It's the system that you are forced to comply with.  <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v70n3/v70n3p111.html">Read here about social security benefits slated to be available until 2037</a>This is America.  We pay taxes on our goods and services.  We pay taxes on our property.  We pay taxes on our income.... And yes, we pay into a retirement system called social security.  Add the money that taken out of many of our checks for health care and now you see that those who make $50,000 a year are really only walking away with $35,000.  It's because of the system we support... But alas, look at what they are about to do...  <br><br>
		
	<span style="font-weight: 500">I want to know what happened to the 20% that's missing!</span><br><br>

    What would you say to a person that comes up to you and says, hey, I need you to give me a $100 every week and I promise to pay you back when you get 62 years of age.... Now, once you start getting close they come back and say... Hey,  I know I owe you a whole lot but I'm only going to be able to give you back 80% of what I promised.... Then, they come back ten years later and say, you know what, we need to reform the system.  We need to make it so that you can't get the 80% of what I owe you until you turn 65, I mean 67, I mean 70... Do you see what I'm getting at here...  This might be the biggest Con Job in American History.  Let's take money from every last American for their entire career, then, let's only give them 80% of what we promised them.  Oh, and then, let's not even give it to them when we promised it.  That way some of them will die off and we won't have to pay it.<br><br>
		
	Is this what our government has turned into?  It doesn't matter whether you are Republican, Democrat, or Independent.  I think we can all see a Con Job this big from a mile away....     <br><br>

My answer is to pretend it does not exist. We have to plan for the worst.  For the 90% of Americans who depend solely on social security for their income, they need to really look at getting their hussle on before they retire.  We need to all get serious about our golden years and take responsibility for the monetary need we will incur as senior citizens.  I am not saying that we do not need to put pressure on our elected officials.  In fact, we do need to do that.  All I am saying is many times the help may come too late for many Americans.  This can sneek up on all of us and when it does, we will be too old to march, too old  to fight and we should not have too.  We need to fight for our benefits now.  We do not need to wait until the hammer falls.  In addition, everyone needs to look into alternate income sources and pursue them aggressively. ';
