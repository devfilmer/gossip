	Just when you thought things were about to slow down and people were going to straighten up... Out of no where comes more bad news.  Yeah, I'm sorry to be the one to break it to you...  I'm sorry that I have to be the messenger.  I'm sorry to that I have to be the one to elaborate on another pitiful incident to add to your doomsday scroll.  Damn it Mr. Cuomo, why did it have to be you.  <img src="images/bennet.png" />You used to be the man.  You were standing tall during the whole pandemic.  You are the one politician who had your finger on the pulse of the problem in your state.  You are the one that could actually read your charts and explain it to the people.  You are the one who could utter a few words and people would actually put on their masks.  You were the Chosen One.  It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them.  bring balance to the force, not leave it in darkness.  But alas, you have.<br><br>

Whether he is guilty or not, Mr. Cuomo now has been added to a long list of undistinguished gentlement accused of sexual harrassment.  What is it going to take to get these guys to learn that you can't put yourself in a predicament where you are being accused of unwanted advances.  The worst part of it is that no matter what he says now, someone will always go back to this.  No matter what incredible legislation, social improvement, or political action he weilds, he will aways be that guy accused by three women (Anna Ruch,Lindsey Boylan and Charlotte Bennet) of sexual harassment. To be honest, I hope none of it is true.  Mr. Cuomo is one of my heroes.  Or should I say was one of my heroes.  I don't want to see one of my heroes fall... But I didn't want to seen Anikan Skywalker turn into Darth Vader either.  I didn't want to see Mike Tyson go to jail.  I didn't want to see Bill Cosby go to jail.  I didn't want to see Kevin Spacey ripped of the big screen..... and that's just a few. <br><br>

		I guess we'll keep seeing dumb stuff like this until someone invents an app that pinches them right before they mess up.

It\'s a raw deal any way you slice it.  I can not think of a single instance where a public official accused of sexual assault faired well.  Not one.';
