   </p>
    <p style = "font-size:20px">

It's a fair question. Mr. Desantis, what were you thinking?<br><br>

If you do not know what's going on, it may be time that you really look at Mr. Ron DeSantis and assess what it is he is trying to achieve. There is no way in the world if I were running for president that I would want 33 million African Americans angry with me from my own home state. On top of that what about the 12% of the 300 million Americans that are African-American? There is no way I would want this entire race of people looking at me and wondering if I were a Racist. Oh, with all of the police brutality, marginalization of Black people, and cancel culture, it is amazing that someone who is supposed to represent every American is striking out at different groups within our society.<br><br>

The worst thing he could’ve ever done was to open fire on black history with a sitting African-American female currently serving as Vice President of the United States. This is a miscalculation that can only be measured once the voting starts. The idea that the GOP is a racist group of people with agendas that do not benefit the masses coupled with the idea that all people don’t have value in our society or have an equal footing is clearly a prominent point of view possessed by the majority of African Americans.  And for that matter, many Caucasian Americans.  For this reason, diversity programs have been stood up to put in place policies that increase opportunities for marginalized and disenfranchised people in the United States.<br><br>

Mr. DeSantis has served as governor of the state of Florida for 4 years. He took office January 8th, 2019. During that time Desantis claims to have bolstered the economic growth of Florida.  Florida's job growth rate was 2.09% in 2019 which out paced the national growth of 1.7% that year. The very next year, Florida saw a job rate decrease of 4.91 percent.  He also claims that the economic growth in Florida prior to him was not successful and that his policies that he enacted with his staff were crucial to the economic growth that Florida is enjoying today. However, you can see from the chart below that Florida has had a sustained job growth increase above 2% since 2013.<br><br><img src = "images/floridajobgrowth.png"/>

Despite Florida's achievements over the past 10 years, Mr. DeSantis has effectively created a dangerous racial divide in Florida’s by removing diversity, equity and inclusion polices that were inacted to combat Jim crow laws and critical race theory artifacts embedded within our society since the 1960s. Now many organizations are leaving Florida due to the toxic racial environment and the collapse of the insurance industry. The question that is whether this damage is irreparable? Is it possible that these organizations may never return. What economic damage will result over the next 10 years because Florida is now recognized as a hostile racial environment? How many African-American businesses will continue to leave that have not left yet.  How many businesses will not return because of Mr. Ron DeSantis promotion of policies that do not recognize the marginalization of African American people throughout the years.  And how many businesses that are multi racial/ multicultural will no longer want to do business in the state of Florida because of these racist policies and agendas. How many minorities that are in positions of authority and positions of influence, will recommend to their organizations that they seek other locations for their businesses, in other states.  And last, how many Americans will remember Mr. DeSantis' ideology when it comes time to select a 2024 GOP Candidate to face Mr. Joe Biden for President of the United States?

      echo '<br><h2For members only:</h2><br> <hr style="height: 5px" color="#C75000">It is really unfortunate that someone who has so much potential to lead America beyond 2024 does not realize that America is more than one people. America is a diverse population of people all seeking to have a better life and to provide for their families.  All Americans have the right to pursue their passions and to be treated equitably.  And unfortunately, institutionalized prejudice has been shown to exist time and again throughout American history via studies and assessments.  You can not just erase history and put policies in place that provide a fertile seed bed for racism, inequitable hiring practices, and hypocrisy.  Especially if you are running to be the President of the United States.
