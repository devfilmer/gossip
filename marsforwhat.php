		There's really not a more beautiful time of year than right now on our planet.  After a long winter, here comes the sun... and with it, here comes new growth, new life, new vegetation, and the promise that our Mother Earth is indeed generous and very capable of supporting all who dwell upon her.  But now, can we still say this is the case.  Every day we hear a new story about climate change, global warming, dwindling natural resource, endangered species, and the possiblity that there will not alway be life on Earth.  I don't know about you, but I don't believe it.  I don't believe that as far as mankind has come that we will not be capable of sustaining life on Earth.  Ok, yeah, we've screwed some things up.  We've built machines emitting to many harmful emissions into our atomosphere.  We've strained the production of oil and gas on the planet.  We've scraped the land for our own population driving the animals further and further to the ends of the Earth.  We've poluted the oceans of the Earth, killing hundreds of thousands of sea creatures and we know that man's desire for power and dominion gave birth to weapons of mass destruction.  <br><br>
		
		So does this mean it's time to find another home?  There is this insatiable desire to determine if we are not alone in the Universe.  You hear it all the time... The search for extraterestrial life.  NASA has launched numerous missions in an attempt to research if there are other life forms amongst us.  They've developed telescopes that can see further than we've ever been capable of seeing.  We've discovered a number of planets floating around the closest star to our sun (Alpha Centauri).  They're claiming these planets may be very similar to Earth... capable of supporting life and possibly already inhabited by intelligent life forms.  There's talk of lush black vegetation covering the planet's surface which is totally foreign to what we have on Earth.  <br><br>
		
		And of course, there's Mars, the red planet.  We've been infatuated with Mars since the early mapping of the planets in the sky in B.C.  How many fantastic movies have their foundation squarely built on the surface of the red planet?  Everyone is absolutely sure that Martians have been visiting Earth for years.  They are green right?  And they have the ability to perform mind control.  Yeah that's it.  And they fly around in flying saucers.  They big bulging black eyes and they carry laser guns.  They're even sure they can shape shift into beings that look like humans and eventually they will get tired of our antics and just crush us and take over the Earth...  Well let me tell you what I think.  It's all bull.  And you know what else, even if it wasn't, who cares.  It they bring their furry green asses to my house talking crap, they won't be catching an kind of flying saucer back to where they came from.<br><br>
		
		In fact, I want to put this whole thing to bed once and for all.  Why the hell are we spending billions of dollars on researching the galaxy?  Look, I saw a damn chinch bug that I've never seen before yesterday in my back yard.  It didn't cost me a thing.  You want to see new life forms... Stop poluting the ocean and build something stout enough to explore it top to bottom.  I bet you might even find some red dirt down there.  Stop developing weapons of mass destruction and figure out how to stop climate change.  Redirect your efforts towards saving this planet rather than looking for chinch bugs on Mars.  We need to stop talking about extraterrestrial life and start focusing on extra quality for human life.  It's just like how we tend to want to leave the neighborhoods we grew up in looking for a better place only to find out when we get older that where you live is only a good as you make it.  If we can't improve  Earth, we have no reason to go to Mars or anywhere else.  <br><br> So much for common sense.
