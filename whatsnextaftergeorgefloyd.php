		So, here we are… approaching one month since George Floyd lost his life during an egregious detainment by the Minnesota Police Department…  And people are now asking, now what?  What’s next?  We’ve seen it all.  We’ve seen protests waged in a myriad of America’s largest cities to include New York NY, Los Angeles CA, Houston TX, Dallas TX, Atlanta GA, Cleveland OH, Seattle WA, Washington DC, and many many others.  We’ve seen civil unrest crop up in smaller cities too like Huntsville AL and Greensville SC… We’ve seen the Black Lives Matter movement grow into a full scale worldwide movement, galvanizing people of all colors, creeds, and cultures to a single cause… and that cause is recognizing police brutality for what it is, a crime against humanity…. and in addition recognizing that racism still exists and is fueling a divide between the people of this world needlessly.  <br><br>

<img src="images/floydprotests/floydprotest4.png" style="width: 30%; padding: 0px 10px 10px 0px; float: left"/>But what is next?  The details of the aftermath of George Floyd’s death are very unsettling.  We’ve seen a surge of violence at so called peaceful protests which aren’t helping the situation.  We’ve seen the National Guard deployed to control protests and to enforce curfews… Well, this  appears to have been a double edged sword…. The mounting violence has even stirred President Trump to consider the deployment of the US Military to support local law enforcement and National Guard in quelling non-peaceful protest, destruction of property, and looting.  We’ve seen an acting Secretary of Defense, Secretary Esper, publicly rebuke President Trump’s consideration of utilizing the Insurrection Act.  We’ve observed retired Defense Secretary, General Mattis, United States Marine Corp, rebuke President Trump right in the middle of all the protests.  We’ve seen both civilians and police run over protesters during the protests.  We’ve witnessed more brutal behavior by law enforcement to protesters.  We’ve seen rubber bullets and bean bags cause horrendous damage to individuals who elected to participate in the protests… and worst of all, we’ve seen more individuals die or suffer bodily harm while participating in the protests.  <br><br>

We’ve heard that some cities are considering not funding the police department… Well, what does that mean?  We’ve heard that Congress is considering new legislation to change the country’s law enforcement practices.  OK, so change them to what?  And we’ve heard founders and CEO’s of major companies like Ben & Jerry’s, Apple, Nike, Hulu, Netflix, Fox, and more come out in support of Black Lives Matter and the I Can't Breathe movement. Somehow, we all know this is just the beginning... <br>

It’s obvious if we look at what has already happened.  <img src="images/floydprotests/floydprotest5.png" style="width: 30%; padding: 10px 0px 10px 10px; float: right"/>There will continue to be kaos, confusion, violence, suffering, pain, and death until there is real leadership, real empathy, real forgiveness, and real understanding.   We are all just people who have to find our way on this dirt ball we call Earth.  Hate inflicted by the inhumane whether they be law enforcement or not, doesn’t matter… Hate inflicted by any human, regardless of ethnicity, is hate and causes pain and suffering.  There will continue to be protests.  There will continue to be bias… There will continue to be misunderstanding and ignorance until…. yes until, there is real leadership… leadership that empathizes with all races of people, leadership that supports the education of all people regarding the non acceptance of racism and police brutality… leadership that rebukes divisive behavior, embraces harmony, and rewards courage.<br> <hr style="height: 5px" color="#C75000">';
