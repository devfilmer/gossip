I'm always hearing talk about the Second Amendment.... Over and over again you hear we have the right to protect ourselves.  We have the right to buy, store, and bear weapons.  And yet there's another side to the story.  And we hear it over and over again told thousands of times a year...  With these so called rights, people like Jay Harrison Boughton are being gunned down in what appears to be a senseless killing of a man driving his son home from a baseball game... Nothing about this is right.  A senseless killing of a kid's baseball coach in Minnesota.  How do you explain that to people?  How do you accept that?  Is it reasonable that you could leave your home to attend a public event for your child and find yourself being shot at on the way home? <br><br>

Is this what America has come to?  What transpired on the road that gave someone cause to shoot a man driving his son home from a baseball game?  Did he harm someone?  Did he flip someone off?  Did he bump someone's car?  Truth is it doesn't matter what happened.  I can't think of what could possibly justify shooting someone on the highway.  You'd have to do something seriously wrong... And from what I've researched, there doesn't appear to be anything that suggests that Jay Boughton deserved being gunned down on the road.     <br><br>

Every time I see a story like this, it tests my faith in the Constitution.  Specifically, my faith in the Second Amendment.  Stories like this should make everyone very aware of the reality that no one is safe in America.  As long as there are idiots and as long as there are guns available, no one is safe... not in our schools, not at work, not in our shopping centers, not in our homes, not at our restaurants, and not even on our way home from a kid's baseball game.<br><br>
To the family of Mr. Jay Harrison Boughton, we extend our condolences and our prayers.
