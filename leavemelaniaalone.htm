Let's Get Real for a moment.  Now these days, not many are making any kind of attempt to stand up for the First Family. 
But, sometimes we just don't have any choice.  On 26 November, Melania Trump, the First Lady of the United States was met 
with jeers and booing at the University of Maryland.  It was a dispicable display of ignorance.  The woman was there to
speak about the opioid crisis...  And what does she get, booed by brats!  Yeah, brats... <br><br>Oh, does that sound
harsh?  I have to ask myself.  Why are they booing.  Is it because of the impeachment hearings?  Is it because of her
outfit?  Is it because of her husband?  What the hell are they booing about?  She's the First Lady of the United States.
She deserves every opportunity to speak just as any other First Lady has spoken.  People must learn that it is a privilege to 
have the opportunity to hear high ranking officials and their spouses at such engagements and not to take it for granted.
<br><br>
		She could have spoken any where she wanted to. It's a shame some don't know when to boo and when to listen!
