    <h1>Goshen Hospital Indiana Incidents!</h1>

Folks, can you imagine going to the hospital for surgery of any kind only to find out later that you may have been exposed to hepatitus or hiv while at the hospital.  It's an unthinkable proposition that you went to a place to get help only to be put in a situation where there is no help. And yet that is exactly the case for some 1,182 patients of Goshen Hospital in Indiana. Now let me be clear.  I have never liked hospitals.  The idea that this is a building filled with sick people that have every thing that can be wrong with you has always been troubling for me.  I've been called superstitious, crazy, and even ridiculous but then here we go with Goshen Hospital.  <br><br><a href="
	https://www.channel3000.com/health/hospital-sanitizing-error-may-have-exposed-over-1000-patients-hiv/1145304131"> Read More. </a><br><br>If you had surgery between April 1, 2019 and September 30, 2019, you might have been exposed to a myriad of diseases if your procedure was conducted at Goshen Hospital.  In fact, there is now a <a href = "https://www.goshennews.com/news/lawsuit-filed-against-goshen-hospital/article_69c91c60-0d75-11ea-a91e-17c03a08e47c.html">class action law suit</a> underway for the patients who may have been exposed.  All I can think is damn, damn, damn.  What happens to a hospital when an incident like this occurs.  Of course there will be law suits galore but do they just go ahead and knock the building down. I know I wouldn't go there after hearing about this incident.  <br><br>
		
	You get one chance to kill me.  After that, it's someone elses turn!
