    <h1>A Moment of Silence for Animal Care Providers:  Dog kills woman in Florida at A Hundred Abandoned Dogs of Everglades Florida</h1>
   <p>

   </p>
    <p>

It is almost a thankless job that so many animal lovers take on with such intense compassion... the charge of caring for animals that have been hurt, abused, or left behind.  It's hard.  It's tedious.  And it can be very very dangerous.  Such is the case in the incident which has stirred the residents of Everglades, Florida, where a woman was killed by a dog she was attempting to provide care to.  It's a tragedy that no one wants to hear about...  It's something no one wants to dwell upon.  The mixed breed animal managed to hurt one woman while killing another and these were professionals who love what they do.  It's an unthinkable loss for the families and we should all stop for a moment and reckognize the courage of these individuals and so many others who have dedicated their lives to helping animals.<br><br>
	This incident is not something that has never happended.  There are some 4.7 million dog bite incidents that occur annually according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Humane Society of the United States ....   In addition, there are over 400 deaths that occur due to dog attacks that take place annually in the United States.  These deaths are attributed to 10 different dog breeds with 21% coming from mixed breed dogs.  What are the breeds you might ask?  <a href = "https://www.superbdog.com/dog-bite-statistics/">Check out this article</a> for more information.<br><br>

	  So, you might be wondering what the point of this analysis might be.  It's time we took a hard look at the animals and perhaps the policies which enable shelters to care for them.  We have the facts that clearly show a pattern.  Dogs are attacking inside care facilities, at peoples homes, and unfortunately out in the open.  You never know when you might encounter one.  You could simply be walking to the mailbox and here comes you neighbor's Chow who just got loose... and who knows what happens next.  Should their be laws that prohibit the ownership of certain breeds?  Should there be policies that dictate that certain animals are illegal to own or even shelter.  These are questions it may be time to take a hard look at.  We owe it to the brave ones who put their lives on the line to care for man's so called best friend.
