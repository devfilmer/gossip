		So, as the world marches past 272,000 deaths scattered across 180 countries due to the COVID-19 Corona Virus, the idea that some miracle vaccine has begun to fascinate politicians, scientists, and those in need.  It's the unfortunate fall out of a pandemic which has no mercy and no true end in sight.  Even as these words sprinkle on this page, thousands of people are becoming infected for the first time.  They're scared.  They're upset and desperate.  This makes them willing to do almost anything to rid themselves of their predicament... including listening to far fetched ideas regarding vaccines that will be ready possibly by the end of 2020.  Really, I have to ask a few serious questions.  <br><br>
		
		Do they have a vaccine for HIV/AIDS?  Do they have a vaccine for cancer? And what about lupus?  What about alzheimer's?  What about diabetes?  Do you see where I'm going with this.  The world is full of extremely gifted and talented people who are truly doing their best to make progress towards erradicating disease but the truth is, it's just plain hard.  So hard in fact that the most they have been capable of doing is treating patients... sometimes successfully, sometimes not.... And so we come to the greatest wish of wishes regarding sickness and disease.  Can you give me just one damn shot and prevent every damn thing?  Can you?  Tell me Dr. Fauci, do you have a magical needle buried in a briefcase neatly tucked in the trunk of your car that will clear all levels of clinical trial by the end of the year so everyone can get back to chilling at the beach, eating big macs, and scarfing down Popeye's fried chicken without the risk of contracting the coronavirus while eating in public.  <br><br>
		
		Oh, forgive me, my bad... it's not Dr. Fauci's fault... It doesn't matter whose fault the coronavirus is.  Let's just figure out how to beat this thing... So, how would that work?  That's right... if we create a vaccine, this will solve everything.... Will it?  How?  We'll create a vaccine, line everyone up, administer it, and then everything will be ok... No more virus...  Right?  Let's see, line everyone up, administer the vaccine and everything will be ok... What am I missing here?  Ha, everyone... that's what I'm missing.  <a href="https://www.isidewith.com/candidates/donald-trump/policies/science/mandatory-vaccinations">They intend to give the vaccine to everyone.</a>  So let's think about this.  The coronavirus as of 8 May, 2020 has infected 3,910,738 people with some 272,778 people dying from the disease.  That means right now, on average, if you get the corona virus, you have almost a 7% chance of not making it.  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/08/moderna-ceo-says-supply-of-coronavirus-vaccine-will-be-limited-us-will-help-decide-who-gets-it-first.html">I wonder what will happen if the rush to produce a vaccine results in the relaxation of current clinical trials.</a>  It's going to take time to produce a real vaccine.  <a href="https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-science/developing-vaccine">Look at the link regarding the development of a vaccine for HIV.</a>  We've been struggling to find an effective vaccine since the 1980s... I'll say it again... Since the 1980s.  That's forty years yall... and we're not there yet.  <a href="https://www.labiotech.eu/medical/neovacs-lupus-vaccine-phase-ii/">Look at where we are with regards to lupus.</a>  Marked progress has been made to treat diseases such as cancer and diabetes but there's no definitive cure.... Armed with the knowledge of the history of the world's ability  to create cures and vaccines, I think we can safely predict that it will take years to find a viable vaccine that truly can immunize the masses.  Therefore, the world needs to focus on prevention, self-reliance, and independence.  We need to dissolve our dependency on corporate entities to provide food.  We need to focus on natural cures for common ailments so trips to the hospital are minimized.  We need to take every preventative measure we can to prevent contracting the virus.  <br><br>

		So, what happens if scientist determine that the only way to truly stop the coronavirus is to conduct a mandatory vaccination of the populous?  How many Americans will determine that they do not wish to be vaccinated by a rushed vaccine?  How many industries and organizations will require it's personnel to adhere to vaccination or face a termination to their employment?  And what recourse do the people have if the vaccine proves to be a failure?  In other words, they become sick as a result of the vaccine rather than the coronavirus.  Does this sound far fetched to you?  These are all things we will have to weigh in the not so distant future.  Imagine, if the coronavirus don't kill ya, the vaccine for it just might.  Terrible thought but it's real...<br><br>
		
		So, If social distancing is truly working with regards to reducing the spread of the coronavirus, Congress should not allow states to resume normal operations without clear research showing that that the public's safety is intact.  Everyone with land should be putting in a garden to limit their dependence on grocery stores and fast food.... and educating the youth with regards to survival in this dangerous environment should become the number one topic of discussion at the dinner table...  Cheer on the scientist, but concentrate on survival.
