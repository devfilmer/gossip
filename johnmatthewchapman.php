		There’s an idea out there that the world is on the edge of chaos and tends towards it every second, every minute, every hour… and that all we do is wake up and try to channel chaos so that we can survive… And were it not for those that wake up every day and attempt to find some way to establish order, the world would end, caving in towards the wickedness of men, crumbling beneath their selfishness, their lust for power, bigotry, idolatry, and immorality.  In fact, there are those that believe that every government system that exists today is geared towards the establishment of a society that builds people who are servants born to support, nurture, protect, and build the machine.  There are no individuals and yet there are only individuals.  We have all been planted, groomed, and set out to serve a specific purpose in society.. A society that’s not perfect, a society filled with evil and wretchedness.<br><br>
		And I know people get tired of hearing the doom and gloom but it must be pointed out so we see it for what it is and know that it’s real.  <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/29/us/jaime-feden-john-chapman-investigation/index.html">Such is the case with a 40 year old man named John Matthew Chapman who fooled a young 33 year old woman name Jaime Feden into believing he was taking her on a photo shoot in the desert in Las Vegas.</a>  Little did she know that John would strap her to a signpost, tape her mouth, and leave her too suffocate.  Even worse, this man would strip her clothes, return to her Pennsylvania residence, and impersonate her on social media.  It would take two months for her body to be found and for authorities to determine what had happened.  <br><br>I have to ask myself why did this happen to this woman?  What did she do to deserve this?  Why would a man commit such a heinous crime?  He must be mentally deranged. Right?  Is it possible that Jaime didn’t know that this man was sick?  Does it even matter?  Does what matter you might be asking.  Does it matter if Jaime knew John was sick?   I think the answer is it doesn’t matter.  What happened to Jaime should not have happened.  In fact, it’s totally unacceptable.  As a matter of fact, when I hear that there will be a trial and that they will determine whether John will serve life in prison or may face the death penalty, I don’t understand that.  This man took a woman to the desert, bound her up, stripped her down, and left her for dead.  He impersonated her on social media according to investigators.  <br><br>
When there are weeds in the garden, they don’t get a trial.  We don’t dig them up and give them a life sentence in another area of the yard so they can choke out whatever life is in that area.  When there are rats in the attic or dangerous snakes in the flower bed threatening to bite or harm our loved ones, we don’t say, awe what a cute venomous critter, let’s catch it so it can live somewhere else.  We terminate them.  It’s a matter of survival.  Sexual predators, murderers, kidnappers, rapists, torturers, serial killers, and those violent individuals who insist on destroying the lives of others are nothing more than weeds in the garden.  Why is that so hard to see?  Should there be a death penalty?  There already is.  If you choose to not weed the garden, you sentence the good plants to death…. and chaos rules the day.  It's a simple choice.  What do you want to live, the good plants or the weeds.
