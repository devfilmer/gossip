		It’s got to be rough thinking you could pull out your wallet, make a couple of cute ads, put on a smile and run for president only to find out that those you are running against are willing to barbecue your ass to beat you.  Ms. Elizabeth Warren demonstrated her barbecuing skills during the last presidential debate in a way that will never be forgotten.  <a href ="https://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshh2f4568so87R56e1Q">It was a world star worthy performance</a> leaving Mr. Bloomberg looking like the perfect rotisserie chicken on national television.  <br><br>
		
		<img src = "images/Bloomberg/bloomberg5.png"/>
		<br><br>
		It was worse than Cowboy vs the Infamous One.  It was worse than Fury vs Wilder.  It was a Mike Tyson level knock out destroying any chance Bloomberg had of ever being elected to anything ever again.  I felt sorry for him.  Someone should have called a medic.  He should have left the stage in a body cast.  It was borderline defamation of character except for one thing.  Bloomberg never denied any of Senator Warren’s allegations.  “Fat broads” and “Dog face lesbians”!  Damn, for real?  Looks like Senator Warren stopped and frisked your ass Mr. Bloomberg!  If I were you, I’d go back to New York, get me one of those Coney Island hot dogs,  a cold drink, a neck brace and an ice pack.

      echo 'I mean it was like from the word go.  Ms. Warren slapped Bloomberg\'s ass like he had said something about her mamma.  She wasn\'t hearing his bull shit and the whole world got to see why it doesn\'t matter how much money you have in America.  This woman took Mr. Bloomberg down in less than three minutes.  She rattled off everything he\'s ever done wrong and destroyed his career, his reputation, and his name for good.  Now when you hear the name Bloomberg, it will never sound the same.  Bloomberg sounds like Hindenberg now.  I don\'t know how he stood there and took that but I guess when you are catching a beat down, you don\'t realize it until later.';
