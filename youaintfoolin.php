		There almost seems to be two distinct periods in time now.  There is life before the Coronavirus and life after the Coronavirus.  And the sad part is, there’s not a soul on the planet that was not affected.  The pandemic is a phenomenon that has destroyed our metered lives and overturned our sense of security.  We’ve been left with a society filled with fear and anxiety.... frustration and impatience,  social distancing and regret...  And as people all over the world begin to take hold of this new dark reality, where they cover their faces with masks and hunker down in their homes afraid to go outside... a new earth begins to emerge.  <br><br>

Our new earth outlines a reality where death has increased around us... where fear of the outbreak has resulted in insanity at the supermarket, and where money can not protect you.  The number of people who have the virus is overwhelming.  Truth is, everyone knows that there’s no telling how many have it.   The death rate appears to be anywhere from 0.5 to 10 percent.  There’s no toilet paper hardly anywhere and folks are buying up everything like it’s the apocalypse... while government’s draft bailout plans that won’t cure the virus.<br><br>

Meanwhile, health personnel have become heroes all over the world as they dare to provide care to those who have come down with the virus.  It’s one hell of a thing... applause from the windows and roof tops as they march out into the world to face the pandemic and as they straggle home day in and day out...  <br><br>

Schools are closing!  Teleworking and telehealth are really taking place.  The Coronavirus went from being an overlooked story to the only story.  But what I want to know is when are they going to stop lying about the virus.  I don’t believe a virus just jumped out of thin air and started killing people... No, I don’t believe that six feet of distance will save you from catching it either.  Nope, I don’t believe that it’s just a matter of not touching surfaces where the virus resides... Why?  Because it’s moving too fast... or maybe we’re moving too slow... take your pick...  The U.S. went from 15 confirmed cases to having over 80,000 cases in less than 2 months... translation, no one knows how many have it or who had it.  And yes, it’s getting worse.  The clock is ticking... There’s now even talk that it’s worse than the Spanish flu of 1918.  <br><br>

As of 27 March, 2020, there were over 542,000 people around the world who had been diagnosed with having Coronavirus and over 24,000 have died from it.  That’s around the same number of people the Japanese lost at the Battle of Guadalcanal.  There are now more people who have been exposed to the Coronavirus than there were Americans exposed to agent orange in Vietnam.  The comparison of the virus exposure to the casualties of past conflicts is purposefully direct.  The virus appears to behave more like a biological weapon as opposed to a disease...  lethal, indiscriminate, and consistent.  Like agent orange, pesticide, or herbicide released to kill something.<br><br>

They say Coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China.  There’s certainly a lot of people who have been exposed there and who have died there.  But, I don’t believe that either.  I don’t believe half of what the media is reporting!  I do believe that the sun rises in the East and sets in the West.  I believe the wind blows from west to east.  As a matter of fact, I believe the jetstream’s wind speed is between 110 mph and 250 mph.  There’s only 6,824 miles between Wuhan, China and Los Angeles, CA.  Hell, average the jetstream speed to 180 mph.  Divide 6,824 miles by 180 mph and see what you get.  I got 37.9 hours.  Call it 38 hours.  Can a virus live in the air for 38 hours?  <a href= “https://www.npr.org/2020/03/13/815307842/research-coronavirus-can-live-for-a-long-time-in-air-on-surfaces “>Look at this research.</a>. 

		<a href = "https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/03/20/sars-cov-2-survive-on-surfaces">And this one...</a>
Wait a minute.  <a href = "https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.technologyreview.com/s/615348/heres-how-long-the-coronavirus-can-stay-in-the-air-and-on-packages/amp/">Here's one more...</a>




They all appear to say 3 to 4 hours in the air.. but that’s just what they can detect.  Is it possible that there are still particles in the air after 4 hours?  But the truth is, it doesn’t matter.  Even three hours in the air is too long... imagine someone expelling the virus on everything and everyone around them for 24 hours.  Now imagine the virus lingering for 3 to 4 hours after they’ve left an area.  People continue to get infected over and over... It never ends.  Unless we hunker down... And folks Ain't hunkering down because they haven't truly evaluated the situation.  Well, we've got aircraft carriers with naval personnel now suffering from coronavirus.  We've got cruise ships with crew members suffering from coronavirus.  We've got news casters with it, celebrities with it, and just plain old ordinary people with it.  We've got children with it.  This doesn' sound like just an average flu.  Could this be a bioweapon?  Could this have been an accident?  If it is, who set it off?  Why?  And when are they going to tell the truth about this coronavirus.  You think you can spray folks with round up and get away with it.  They Ain't Fool'n Nobody!  This might be the greatest cover up in human history.  We are sitting around waiting for someone to declare a death toll in the hundreds of thousands a victory.  And Once the People realize what really happened, you can bet they will be pissed and there will be hell to pay!
