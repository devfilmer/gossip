This was one of the saddest stories that swept the nation. The story of a beautiful 3 year old innocent child playing outside at a birthday party.  Then out of nowhere comes the most evil, demonic, stupid, pathetic criminal who kidnaps her, kills her, then takes her body parts to a landfill.  It was in the news and every social media imaginable.  It brought about hurt, shame, anger and most of all a question that everyone wants to know?  Where was this baby's parents or caretaker?<br>
A male and female were charged with the murder because their vehicle matched the description of the one parked near the apartment complex where CUPCAKE was last seen. They are in jail without bond. However, there are some who say that this child was a victim a drug situation. All over YouTube, many allege that the child's father owed drug money but wouldnâ€™t pay. Therefore, his Child suffered the consequences.  The word is out that his own family members beat the brakes off of him at his own daughter's funeral.   SMH... True or no!  <br><br><a href="

We are living in a world full of cruel people. Its gotten worse over the years. There was a time where the whole community could watch after our kids.  Those were the "Big Mama" and "Mu Dear" days. Yes, we miss them!  Nevertheless, we have to watch our children. Don't blink an eye. Never assume that you know people.  There is always someone watching all of us when we least expect it.  At the age of 3, someone was watching CUPCAKE called the devil.  Her life was taken. But, we know that her Spirit is with God and for sure she will never be forgotten.
