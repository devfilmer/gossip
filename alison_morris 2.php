		So as Black History Month, 2020 comes to a close,  it is is important to note a few facts.  It has been 157 years since President Abraham Lincoln freed slaves in America.  It has been 52 years since the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King.  It has been 57 years since the assissination of Medgar Evers.  It has been 57 years since Governor George Wallace stated there would be segregation forever.  It has been 39 years since Michael Donald was lynched in Mobile, AL.  It has been 9 years since the Martin Luther King Memorial was opened in 2011 in Washington D.C.  It has been 66 years since the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States.  It has been 11 years since the inauguration of President Barack Obama as the 44th President of the United States.  And yet, <a href="https://www.essence.com/news/alison-morris-msnbc-n-word-kobe/">Ms. Alison Morris is calling folks niggers on national television while conducting a broadcast regarding the beloved, heralded, fallen Kobe Bryant.</a>  What the Hell Was She Thinking.  <br><br>
		
	  <h1>Don't Say You Didn't Say IT!</h1><br>
	  <a href = "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jan/29/blog-posting/no-msnbc-reporter-was-not-fired-over-viral-live-ai/">Watch it Here!</a>

		<br><br>It's 2020 folks.  This kind of freudian slip is indicative of the kind of senseless racist careless ignorance that plagues American culture.  It demonstrates that there is still a remnant of people who either are teaching racist agendas or who are not sympatheic to all peoples.  After 244 years of slavery in the United States and after the first known usage of the word "Nigger" in 1574 some 446 years ago, it is amazing that someone charged with reporting the news could slip and call folks the N Word on TV in 2020.  I'll make this short.  Damn it MSNBC, get your shit together.  Ms. Morris, you need to keep saying you are sorry until we all believe it.  Don't dress it up with bull saying you were trying to say Nicks and Lakers.  That's bull and I'm not buying it.  You are a NBC News journalist Damn it! Say you are sorry.  Say you're sorry again.  And every time someone ask you to say you're sorry just say it. People make mistakes. But we can't cover them up.  We have to recognize we've made a mistake.  Govenor George Wallace realized he had made a mistake.  Many Americans have realized that the enslavement, beating, raping, torturing, lynching, and degradation of other races is not just wrong, it's inhumane. Say you're sorry again.
