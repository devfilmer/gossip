I'm not sure why everyone is so surprised about the election.... Ok, let's talk about this.  Can't we all agree that Mr. Trump did everything in his power to not get elected.  He fired everyone he could.  He alienated every minority group on the planet.  He insulted women all over the globe.  Didn't he get impeached?  I can't remember.  I was too busy wondering if we were about to be at the brink of war with Iran.  Yeah that's right.  Oh wait, wan't there a trade war with China too.  I can't keep up.  He spent billions in tax payer revenue on a wall that will never be finished.  He never recognized the Black Lives Matter Movement.  In fact, he came very close to using the Armed Forces of the United States to restore order.  Well, as if that wasn't enough, the debates were the most adversarial I've ever seen.  I had to ask myself, are these guys going to be gentlemen or is this about to break into an MMA match... They were bringing each others families into the debate and calling each other names.... I wasn't sure it was a Presidential Debate or follow up to Grumpy Old Men.<br><br>

		So what's next?  You've lost your second Attorney General (Mr. Barr)... Or did he quit?   It doesn't matter, he's gone, like so many other who waved the Trump Flag.  And the circus just can't come to an end... Look at the Presidential Pardon Show.  Is it ever going to end.  It's like there will never ever be another Presidential Reality Show that will eclipse this one.  No one will ever be able to reprise Clint Eastwood in the Good the Bad and the Ugly.  No one will ever be able to reprise Jaws in the James Bond Movies.  No one will ever be able to reprise Martin in the Martin Lawrence Show.   No one will ever pull off what Don Johnson did in Miami Vice.  No one will be able to redo Friends or Sanford and Son.  That's right.  And no one but no one will ever be able to reprise the President Trump Reality TV series.  ... <br><br>
		
		There's a lot of folks waiting on a pardon from Mr. Trump.... It's like turning on the light's and watching the roaches scatter.  I don't know why they even hide.  We all know roaches when we see them.  I sure hope they leave Mr. Trump alone.  He has provided all Americans and endless amount of laughter even if it was Dark humor... The pitiful sitcom has finally come to it's end.  There won't be a sequel.  There won't be a second season.  You lost Mr. Trump.  Accept it.  BRAVO.  Take a bow.  It's time to go home.<br><br>
