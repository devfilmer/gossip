	Christmas is the one time of year where most Americans actually stop and spend time with their families.  They celebrate their religions traditions and show affection for their children, siblings, parents and friends.  They buy gifts and create extraordinary delectables to delight their guests... And it's the one time of year where many go out of their way to communicate with their extended family and friends...  That's why what Mr. Anthony Quinn Warner did is so disturbing.  <br><br>
		
		<img src="images/quinnrv.png"/>
		
	What drives a man to sit down and literally design a sinister plan to blow up Nashville on Christmas day, destroying businesses, subjecting innocent people to possible death, all while broadcasting a delusional warning from his RV telling everyone to evacuate the area... <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/29/us/nashville-bombing-petula-clark-downtown-song/index.html">And then to have the nerve to play the "Downtown" song the whole time... on Christmas day.</a>  But that's not all, I'm convinced he knew what he was doing.  <br><br>
		
		
		
		Do you think it was just coincidence that the explosion knocked out communications for almost three days starting on Christmas?  What message was Mr. Quinn trying to send?  Who was he trying to send it too?  Who was he trying to hurt?  <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/29/us/nashville-bomb-christmas-tuesday/index.html">Why was he so angry that he was willing to kill himself and potentially others on Christmas day in Nashville, Tennessee.</a> We may never know.  But one thing is for certain and someone has to say this with no apologies.  AT and T got the phone systems back up Mr. Quinn.  The communications you knocked out on Christmas Day are back up Mr. Quinn.  People still sang their Christmas carols.  They had their turkey dinners.  They continued to celebrate the holidays Mr. Quinn.  You were ready to retire and have the time to indulge yourself with whatever your heart desired... and what did you do?  You turned your ragedy RV into a bomb and tried to ruin the holidays.  Well, you failed Mr. Quinn.  You failed.  <br><br>
		
		This is America...   And you should know that the notion that you could actually blow up Christmas is idiotic at best.  Virtually the entire population of the earth synchronizes time based on the birth of Christ... I.E.  B.C., A.D.  What the hell were you thinking Mr. Quinn?  You wasted your life.  You wanted to be famous.  Well, congradulations.  You'll be forgotten in a week.
