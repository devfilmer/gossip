Why is it that every time I turn around I see another article hating on Kamala Harris?  It just appears that no one has anything good to say about the Vice President.  That's right, she's the Vice President of the United States.  There appears to be some sort of disconnect between the media and Mrs. Harris.   They have absolutely no scruples with regard to pointing out any sort of verbal error she makes.  They appear to be sitting there waiting to write down the one thing she says wrong instead of the 50 things she said right.  It's really sad.  Why is it that they would rather point out what they think she's doing wrong than count of the things she's doing right?  Why is it that they insist she's not doing anything and then in the same sentence complain when she goes down to Tenessee to face a botched Tennessee legislature.  Why is it that when Kamala stops to be interviewed by a child, the media makes a circus event out of it?  And why is it that the media keeps pressing an insidious adgenda to dismiss Kamala on the Biden-Harris ticket for 2024?   It really appears to be clear to me.  It's something that I just hate to say out loud.  Why?  Because it shouldn't be the case in 2023 that America has a problem with the empowerment of women.  And yes, it appears that the thought of a black woman potentially becoming the President of the United States is terrifying to some.  What other explanation could there be for continually badgering Kamala?  It angers me really.  Let Kamala Do Her Job.  Leave Kamala Alone.  She's an elected official with a proven track record for leading change, fighting for the people, and serving with a conscience.  Why is it no one ever says that?  <br><br>

      echo '<br><h2For members only:</h2><br> <hr style="height: 5px" color="#C75000"><br>It appears that no matter how hard Vice President Harris works and no matter how many speeches she gives, there\'s always someone waiting to accuse her of creating "Word Salads".  This is probably the most insulting accusation bestowed on Kamala Harris.  Why you might ask?   Well, how many other elected officials in Congress have awkward manerisms when they address the floor during their hearings?  How many of them struggle to put words together when they are delivering their testimonies?  Frankly, how many of them appear to be struggling just to read their prepared statements on a daily basis?  And yet, there doesn\'t appear to be any agenda to add these elected officials to the "Word Salad" Club.  As a matter of fact, it almost appears to be a title that Vice President Harris has to carry alone.   There\'s not a single human being I know of who has not struggled to communicate at some point whether it be during a public speaking engagement or even writing their ideas down in paragraph form for public consumption.    <a href ="https://nypost.com/2023/04/26/vp-harris-has-head-scratching-moment-during-abortion-rally/"/> Why is it that Kamala is the target for this incessant barrage of criticism?</a>
<br><br>
Many may not believe that there is an agenda to dismiss Kamala Harris as President Joe Bidens running mate in 2024.  And if you are one of those people, take a look at some of these headlines:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5f099e16-c6a4-4a0a-8418-fae2dde78499">Joe Biden sticks with Kamala Harris despite rocky tenure as vice-president</a>
<li><a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/kamala-harris-approval-rating-polls-vs-biden-other-vps/">What Does America Think Of Kamala Harris?</a>
<li>
<li><a href = "https://nypost.com/2023/04/26/vp-harris-has-head-scratching-moment-during-abortion-rally/">Kamala Harris word salad speech at pro-abortion rally blasted by critics: ‘Legalizing weed was a mistake’</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/06/us/politics/kamala-harris-vice-presidenct-legacy.html">Kamala Harris is trying to define her Vice-Presidency.  Even her allies are tired of waiting.</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/03/22/opinion/should-replacing-kamala-harris-really-be-unthinkable/">Should Replacing Kamala Harris Really Be Unthinkable?</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/video/harris-trashed-loud-speech-defending-163446331.html">Harris trashed for \'loud\' speech defending expelled Tennessee Democrats</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqFb6p6381A">There is a reason Kamala Harris approval rating is in the 30s</a>
</li>
</ul> 
<br>
Is it possible that Kamala Harris\'s approval rating has been deflated as a result of malicious media reporting with a not so hidden agenda.  You can hear it when they speak.  You can feel it every time the camera\'s roll.  It\'s almost like they hate to see her standing there.  They want someone else there.  And yet, she\'s doing the job in spite of all the criticism, all of her imperfections, and all of their hate.  She\'s making a difference for the American people.  <br><br>

And what are Kamala Harris\'s accomplishments you might ask?  Well, here are just a few that we may all need to wrap our heads around.
<ul>
<li>She\'s the first African American to serve as Vice President of the United States</li>
<li>She\'s the first Woman to serve as Vice President of the United States</li>
<li>Harris served as the junior United States senator from California from 2017 to 2021</li>
<li>She\'s the first South Asian American to serve in the United States Senate and as Vice President of the United States</li>
</ul>
These are historical facts.  And take a look at this <a href = "https://hbcupulse.com/2023/03/03/kamala-harriss-accomplishments-as-the-49th-vice-president-of-the-united-states/">list of 17 accomplishments by Vice President Harris provided by HBCU Pulse. </a>
<br><br>
It\'s no wonder that when President Joe Biden announced his re-election campaign, he did not listen to the scathing critiques and assaults by the media.  He believes in Kamala.  So why can\'t we?  It\'s time to stop revelling in our shortcomings and to start celebrating our strengths.  It\'s time to stop looking for what\'s wrong without acknowledging what\'s right.  It\'s time to salute Vice President Kamala Harris for her tireless and committed public service and her committment to the preservation democracy.
