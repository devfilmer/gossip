By now, everyone must be wondering how and why Mr. Putin insists on battering the Ukraine into oblivion.  It certainly makes no since to the majority of the world.  And yet, despite council from some of his wisest generals and wealthiest citizens, he continues to strike the Ukraine, day after day, week after week.  The destruction is overwhelming.  The loss of life is horrific.  And all for what?  Everyone is trying to figure out what is Mr. Putin's problem.  Notice how I'm directing the blame squarely on Mr. Putin.  All of Russia can't possible believe that the war is just.  In fact, I don't believe the majority of them believe it.  In many ways, the Ukranians were once part of Russia.  There's no debate there. All of the regimes that have left the former U.S.S.R. are still in fact Russian people.  They may have varying origins, different cultural backgrounds, and different beliefs.  But, they are kind hearted people that just want to live in peace.   It's beyond unfortunate that they once lived free and now in 2022, the Ukranians have lost their homes, love ones, and are slowly losing their country.  Millions have become refugees as this senseless war continues.  And yet, few are bold enough to call this war what it truly is.<br><br>

It's a clear case of modern day barbarianism.  What is barbarianism?  To be barbaric means being crude, uncivilized, or primitive. It's used to describe things people who are cruel or brutal in a way that's considered entirely uncivilized. It involves crude and and uncivilized, cruel, or brutal tactics to effect an outcome.  Does that sound harsh?  Well, ask yourself this question.  If Russia is truly a Superpower, couldn't they have utilized high level diplomacy, incentives, and dialog to achieve whatever their objective actually is.  As a matter of fact, what exactly is Mr. Putin's objective?  What do you actually gain by leveling the Ukraine?  It doesn't win you any support by the native Ukrainians.  In fact, they will hate Russia for at least five generations.  It will not make the land more valuable.  There will be billions necessary to rebuild this country.  And it certainly won't win you any allies or friends.  The whole world is abandonning Russian relations.  Why?  Because no one wants to be associated with senseless violence, barbarianism, killing, destruction, and kaos.  It's simply uncivilized.  War has become uncivilized.  It's an ineffective method of achieving geopolitical objectives unless of course your real objective is genocide.  <br><br>

The world has already become a very small place.  One could make a case that there are no borders.  Modern day weapons can be a threat from anywhere on the globe.  The creation of geographical berms to achieve a physical barrier are useless against long range weaponry.  This includes territorial waters and land buffers.  There's no where to hide anymore.  Modern day satelite technology effectively erases everyone's ability to hide large arsenals of any sort.  Modern media's reach is global.  Troop movements are broadcast in realtime.  You can't just secretly waltz in and take over a country.  And the idea that banning countries from entering into organizations such as Nato will bring nothing short of hate and discontent from the world as a whole.<br><br>  

Mr. Putin, what are you doing?  You're not a barbarian.  Are you?  Because if you are, you need to briefly review your history.  There is not a single Barbaric nation of any stature currently in existence that has prosperous relationships with the world as a whole.  Every barbaric regime throughout history has eventually fallen.  No barbarian regimes can exist in today's world where technology, intelligence, economies of scale, and the ability to negotiate rule.  The world is one people.  We all need each other to survive and thrive.  Russia needs the world.  And the world needs Russia.  We must all co-exist in peace for the well-being of every nation, every people, and for our children.  Mr. Putin, for the love of man-kind, stop the madness.
