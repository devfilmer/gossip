Can you imagine waking up in the hospital, sick with a disease that would leave you having to have your legs and fingers amputated in order to save your life.  It’s a horrible thought and yet that’s exactly what happened to a 19 year old who ate left over chicken and lo mein.  He was <a href ="https://www.nejm.org/doi/story/10.1056/feature.2021.02.19.100086">admitted to the Massachusetts General Hospital</a> where he was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3188232/#:~:text=Purpura%20fulminans%20is%20a%20rare,uncommon%20in%20the%20adult%20population.">purppura fulminans due to meningococcemia</a>, a form of skin necrosis.  It’s terrifying.  This guy was just fine the day before and now, both of his legs have been amputated below the knees as well as a few of his fingers.  It makes you wonder what exactly was wrong with the left overs.  There’s not one of us that doesn’t put left overs in the fridge once we are done…. and then you hear something like this.  It makes you want to just throw everything in the refrigerator away…. But that’s not really practical is it?  So, what can we do?   Or even still, was it just a case of bad leftovers?<br><br>

How many times have you gone out to eat at fast food restaurants and found yourself sick afterward?  Sometimes it’s not from leftovers.  Sometimes it occurs right after you eat.  Don’t pretend like you don’t know what I’m talking about.  You got your tacos.  You ate until you couldn’t eat any more and then found yourself sitting in the bathroom crying to Jesus…. And after you left the rest room, you ended up running back in there over and over.  It took all day for you to get better.  You were looking crap up online about how to deal with it.  You were following the <a href ="https://www.webmd.com/children/brat-diet">BRAT (Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, Toast) diet</a> so your stomach would stop hurting… And yeah, you were pissed off because it screwed up your weekend…. Well, not to make like of the situation, but now you can see, it could have been worse…. And that leaves me with two questions….   Where is it safe to eat out and When is it safe to store the leftover.  I guess we could google these things but right now, I just want to send prayers up for the kid.  <br><br>

I’m convinced that this was more than a case of bad leftovers.  I wonder if before long they uncover evidence of foul play… Then you have to ask, who would do such a thing.  It’s too early to guess what really happened.  We need to sit back and keep an eye on this case.  In the mean time, I think I’ll be cooking and eating more at home.
