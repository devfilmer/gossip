    There's been a lot of focus on who will rise to become the next President of The United States.  In fact, there's been so much focus on who will lead America that no one is really talking seriously about who the Vice Presidential contenders are.  Of course, at this point we realize that the idea of Kamala Harris continuing as America's Vice President is real.  Mr. Biden has made that clear.  But what isn't clear is how the 2024 GOP Vice Presidential picture is shaping up.  So many barbs are being thrown between the Republican candidates that it appears to be an after thought about who will be their running mate.   And yet, this is just as important as their candidacy.  We don't have to reach that far back in history to see just how important it is.  Just look at the record number of times Vice President Kamala Harris was required to break tie votes in the Senate.  Which leads us to the elephant in the room.  <br><br>

    The idea that Mr. Trump will be the 2024 GOP nominee is very real.  The 2024 GOP debates have been a distraction from reality.  There's a large number of Americans that want Mr. Trump back.  And they're angry about it.  So much so that the Make America Great Again slogan has become a powerful movement... powerful enough to stagnate bills in Congress... powerful enough to raise the volume of personalities like Congressman Marjorie Taylor Green and the AOC.  And at the center of it all is perhaps the most dangerous man in America... one who is not afraid to stand and speak convincingly to his colleagues in Congress and get results... a man who has shown unwaivering loyalty to Mr. Donald Trump and even called him the best President we've ever seen.  That man is Mr. Matt Gaetz who represents the 1st Congressional District of Florida.  He is a camera hungry individual who has managed to become perhaps the loudest voice in Congress and managed to lead the toppling of Kevin McCarthy's Speakership in October of 2023.  It should be clear that even without anyone stating it, Mr. Gaetz could be a contender for Vice President of the United States on a Trump Gaetz 2024 ticket<br><br>
    
    Mr. Gaetz is focused.  He is uncompromising.  He is ruthless... He is dangerous.  He does not hold back.  Sound familiar... It should... These are the same traits possessed by Mr. Trump.  Mr. Gaetz has already demonstrated that he can get results in Congress and his loyalty to Mr. Trump.  His energy and ability to pose strong verbal arguements are unquestionable.  It's quite possible that a Trump Gaetz ticket would pose a serious challenge to Mr. Biden and his constituents.  But if they win, will America ever be able to sleep again?

With Mr. Gaetz on the roster, they might as well give up.  It would be a show like none other.  Trump would just send his padawan to execute his will with extreme prejudice.  And from what Mr. Trump has stated, he has many initiatives he is ready to take to include securing the border, dealing with what he considers a broken legal system that was not fair to him, and restoring his policies that he believes were eroded during the Biden administration.
