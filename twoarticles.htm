		So it's game on for the Democrats.  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/house-democrats-unveil-articles-of-impeachment-against-trump/ar-BBY1N3F?li=BBnb7Kz">All aboard for the Trump Impeachment Train...</a>  Next stop: vote for or against the two articles of impeachment brought against President Trump. If you don't have a ticket, please see Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Nadler.  They will be happy to oblige you.  Don't forget to frown as we discuss the charges.  It's very important to look as serious as you can.  These are "high crimes" after all.  The worse the world has ever seen.  Peering out the window to your left, you can hear all the terrible things the President has said that are true/not true, take your pick and looking out the windows to your right.... Wait a minute, let's wake up and look at this closer. <br><br>

Why do the Democrats want to impeach Mr. Trump so badly?  Did anyone die as a result of any of Mr. Trump's actions?  Was any money exchanged as a result of his actions?  If so, was it illegal?  Hmm...  I've never seen so many law makers posing so often and grand standing for the cameras.  What is really going on here?  Now, don't get me wrong.  I'm not defending Mr. Trump.  I'm just asking some serious questions.  What does the Democratic Congress get for removing Mr. Trump from office?  What does the Republican dominated Senate get for defending him?  If anything makes me nervous, it's not knowing if this is really about the law.  I'd really like to believe that Ms. Pelosi.  I really would.  But just a casual once over on the cartoon above and I have this gut feeling that this may not be what everyone might think it is. <br><br>

Sometimes, when we examine American history, we come across things that don't add up.  We see decisions that were made that really don't make sense.  It's almost like watching characters in a play who have some critical line they want to be remembered for once the story has been told and the book has been closed.  You can see it in the cameos and hear it in the sound bites if you listen closely.  It's a sickening desire to make history even if it has nothing to do with doing the right thing.  Ask yourself these questions.  Did <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/burr-slays-hamilton-in-duel">Alexander Hamilton have to participate in that duel?</a>  Did Harry Truman have to drop the atomic bomb?  Did Roosevelt have to establish all of these Federally funded programs that still endure today?  Did Nixon really have to resign?  What drives assassins to pursue carrying out their plans to attack on our leaders?  What is the real reason individuals are attacking ours schools?  When we look at these questions, we may uncover something that is more sinister than the usual culprits for why people do what they do... This time, it's not money they're after.... Nope, it's not greed or power either.  It's something we couldn't see unless we stopped to analyze a common thread underlying all of these incidents.
<br><br>
Notoriety?  Is is possible that the real motive is to be remembered... to be written in the annals of history as the individuals who did this?  It sounds sickening doesn't it.  What a rotten thought right?  But that in fact is the common thread amongst all of these incidents above.  Each one has been inscribed in our history forever.  These individuals will never be forgotten for what they've either said or done.  While millions of people have graced our planet and led remarkable lives and had an incredible impact on the lives of their families, for some this is not enough.  They need more than what a selfie can give them.  Recognition is not enough.  Hell, YouTube can't give them enough attention.  Their impairment requires the world to take note of their existence.  They must be recognized by everyone that hears their name.  They must be remembered for what they have said or what they have done.<br><br>

I hope that the Congress and the Senate of the United States finds a way to objectively look at these articles posed against President Trump....  I'd hate for Americans to realize forty years from now that unfortunately, in 2020, we had a set of law makers more interested in making history than addressing the most serious issues plaguing the United States and threatening its future... (increasing poverty, homelessness, drugs, violent crimes, racial division, sexism, health care, social security, etc.).  Realize that you may not be remembered for doing the right thing quietly but it may be the only way to make the world a better place.
