It’s crazy when you think about it…. Watches you can communicate with, virtual currency, and now headsets that will take you to another world… These were outlandish ideas only believable in the movies.  But now, it’s real.  You can talk via Apple Watch.  You can buy any one of over 4000 virtual currencies and yes, you can visit worlds unknown and currently under construction.  It’s pretty scary if you think about it.  It’s like everything in “Ready Player One” is being made.  I wonder if the folks racing to build the metaverse ever really sat down and watched Ready Player One… It’s really a terrifying idea… that some day our reality would holistically be replace by a headset and our actual main existence would not be in the real world but in this make believe world made up by developers hell bent on entertaining us to a fault. </p> <br><br>

These concepts are no longer just scenes in the movies.  They’ve become the blueprint for the metaverse which is literally being built right before our very eyes… A perfect dystopia where everyone can recreate who they are and live out a fantasy with real currency albeit virtual/crypto currency… And to what end?  It’s an escape from our true physical connection to our planet which could lead to so many world issues that it become beyond what anyone could fathom. </p> <br><br>

Imagine a world where people are more concerned about their play to earn potential than they are about climate change…. a world where they’re more worried about their player level than their education level… a world where people value their real estate in the virtual worlds more then their real estate in the real world… a world where they are more concerned about their avatar’s appearance than their own personal hygiene.  I know what you’re thinking.  It will never get there.  But I beg to differ. When I was a kid, I remember spending hours sitting in front of Atari Space Invaders playing as if my very life depended on it…. flipping the game over and over and over again… And when I look at today’s games, they are far more immersive… far more addictive and far more difficult to put down… As a matter of fact, it’s even becoming easier to live in the virtual world than it is in our real world.  It’s an easy sell.  You just put on the headset, pull out your wallet, and a way you go.  You are only limited by your ability and your cash flow… </p> <br><br>
<p>
So, as the metaverse takes shape, I believe we need to be careful.  We don’t want to get sucked so far in that Ready Player One becomes our chosen reality and our true reality gets thrown in the garbage.
