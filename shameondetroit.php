		I never knew it would come to this.  It really sucks when you have to connect the dots sometimes... When you have to fill in the gaps to get at the truth... When you have to look at the facts and sum it all up and see what you get...  And the deal with Detroit, Michigan is that there's just not a whole lot of good things you can say.  Detroit was ranked the most dangerous city in America in 2020 with over 2,000 violent crimes per 100 thousand people, and over 4,300 property crimes per 100 thousand people.... And oh, guess what, this was before the Coronavirus.  <a href = "https://www.escapehere.com/destination/25-most-dangerous-cities-in-the-us-in-2020/"> Check it out for yourself. </a>  You can't make this stuff up.  You'd think that was a low enough accolade to distinguish "The Motor City" but no, let's keep looking.  <a href = "https://www.foxnews.com/us/deadliest-u-s-cities">Let's see, we got 3rd deadliest city in America for 2018 with 38.9 murders per 100,000 people.</a>  We've got <a href = "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/experience/america/2018/10/17/25-most-dangerous-cities-america/1669467002/">2nd deadliest city in America in 2017.</a>  I guess you <a href = "https://www.alarms.org/top-100-most-dangerous-cities-in-america/">dropped back to number 6 in 2019..</a> But hey look at the bright side, you're number one now!<br><br>
		
		Could it be any worse?  Yeah, how about greater than 10% unemployment with poverty level of the people reaching over 40%.  Ok, so it appears there's a leadership problem.  No, it's a society problem.  No, it's a poverty problem.  No, it's a failure of our government... No, wait, stop everything... Now we have the Coronavirus.  Detroit was already overwhelmed.  Of course this is going to make things worse... But is there any limit to the depths of how bad things can get?  Well, apparently not.  When I saw the body bags of the coronavirus victims being stacked up in waiting rooms because "the morgue staff doesn't work at night", I couldn't believe it... And the nerve of the Hospital leadership to state that they treat all of their patients with dignity after these images had been shared by hospital staff to CNN... Damn, someone has to say it plain.  This is just unacceptable.  <a href ="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/13/health/detroit-hospital-bodies-coronavirus-trnd/index.html">People in body bags stacked up like potatoes with their personal items sitting on top of them in waiting rooms</a>... while hospital staff shares photos of the hospital's incompetence with the world.  There has to be another way to ask for help.  This was not it.<br><br>

		It's morbid.  It's disgusting.  It's unacceptable.  Mayor Duggan, it might be time for Senator Gary Peters and Senator Debbie Stabenow to petition congress for additional funding to help Detroit instead of cutting the hell out of the budget.  Oh, and $5 extra for first responders dealing with coronavirus victim is just straight up BS.  You're going to have to do better than that.  Maybe the Senators can get additional funding while you find someone to run the damn hospital.  It's hard enough watching the world stand up make shift hospitals all over the world while people are dying as they attempt to fight coronavirus... but Detroit, <a href = "https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/13/health/detroit-hospital-bodies-coronavirus-trnd/index.html">we can't stack bodies up in vacant hospital rooms and then take photos to send around the world. </a> <br><br>
		It says alot about Detroit.  And it's not good.
