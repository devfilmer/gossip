    <p>

		First, I want to extend condolences to the family and friends of Mr. George Floyd.  Their suffering can never be measured for the loss of their loved one...   <br><br>
		
		I think Governor Cuomo said it best.  "How many times do we have to learn the same lesson?"  I've been asking myself this question over and over and over again.  How many unarmed men have to be killed by cops before America's law enforcement methods are reviewed and restructured to ensure that excessive force by sick, unsympathetic, hostile cops does not result in the loss of life.  Law enforcement officers are given possibly the greatest responsibility in our society which is ensuring that violence, crime, and unrest do not ultimately plundge our society into kaos.  But unfortunately, there are always bad apples in the bunch.  Such is the case of <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/protests-in-minneapolis-over-george-floyd-death-live-updates/ar-BB14HPlr">Mr. George Floyd who encountered Minnesota police officers</a> who appeared to be conducting a routine search and questioning that ended with what appears to be a heinous crime.  <a href="http://156.98.17.110/media/1195/sample-oath-of-office.pdf">The officers who participated in this act of violence took an oath</a> to support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Minnesota, and promised to discharge faithfully the duties of their office to the best of their judgment and ability. But that ain't what happened.  <br><br>The video is clear as a bell.  Three individuals were apparently pulled over and questioned while in their vehicle.  The driver was Mr. George Floyd.  Passengers were asked to step out of the vehicle first.  Then, Mr. Floyd appears to be escorted from the drivers seat.  Mr. Floyd appears to be escorted with his arm behind him to a side walk where he sits down.  Mr. Floyd is unarmed.  I'll say that again.  Mr. Floyd is unarmed and does not appear to be resisting.  After a brief verbal exchange between the escorting officer and Mr. Floyd, Mr. Floyd is stood up and escorted across the street where other officers arrive.  For some reason, Mr. Floyd ends up face down on the pavement in front of a police car with three cops holding him down.  One pins his legs.  One pins his torso.  And wait a minute, one pins his neck with his knees.  It appears his arms are behind him.  Mr. Floyd continuously states that he can not breathe and that he is in pain.  There's even another cop that appears to stand idly by watching the whole endeavor aimlessly.  A crowd is gathering.  They have their phones out.  They're all recording the whole damn thing.... And this particular pinning of Mr. Floyd litterally from his neck down goes on for over two minutes.  <a href ="https://www.healthline.com/health/holding-your-breath#side-effects">The average person can hold their breath from somewhere between 30 seconds to 2 minutes volutarily.</a>  After three minutes, bad shit starts to happen.  You begin to lose blood flow to the brain.  At five minutes, your body begins to shake.  At six minutes, you can become unconscious.  In Mr. Floyd's case, he was held down while pleading to breathe for over 2 minutes on this video... And from the looks of things, he was there way too long with his body being held down forcibly by three individual restricting him from breathing.  Mr. Floyd died on the asphalt.  His limp body was hoisted up and placed on a gurney.  Everyone who saw this incident must have been in shock.    <br><br>

		I hate hearing about these incidents.  But it just seems we can't get this headline out of the news. Cops are using excessive force.... And when they do, people are dying.  Whether they are armed or not doesn't appear to matter.  A routine traffic stop, might be your last.  I'm not going to sugar coat it.  The officers responsible for this act should be held accountable for their actions.  They are highly trained professionals who know the law.  They are trained to restrain, protect, disarm, and only use lethal force when there is no other alternative.  <img src="images/chauvin.png" style="float:left; width: 30%; padding: 15px 15px 15px 0px;"/>I want you to put yourself in George Floyd's shoes.  Imagine three armed police officers holding you down with your head next to the tire of a police car.  Imagine one officer kneeling on your legs, one kneeling on your back, and one with his knee crushing your neck.  Is this standard operating procedure for how America's officers are trained to restrain individuals?  Did they realize they were killing and unarmed man?  And why is anyone surprised by all the protests going on?  Oh, did I leave out something?  Yes I did.  Mr. George Floyd was black.... Just like <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/08/20/eric-garner-timeline-chokehold-death-daniel-pantaleo-fired/2059708001/">Eric Garner</a>, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/lapd/race/king.html">Rodney King</a>, <a href="https://www.insider.com/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-killed-jogging-travis-gregory-mcmichael-georgia-justice-2020-5">Ahmaud Aubrey</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=262147298305293">Sean Reid</a>, <a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/another-year-another-unarmed-black-man-killed-by-police/">Oscar Grant</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/9aa32033692547699a3b61da8fd1fc62">Michael Brown</a>, <a href="https://chicagocrusader.com/video-shows-cop-brutally-punching-unarmed-black-woman-in-michigan/">Sha’Teina Grady El</a>, and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/fla-teen-trayvon-martin-killed-by-neighborhood-watch-volunteer/">Trayvon Martin.</a>  The excessive use of force by police officers, neighborhood watchmen, and off duty law enforcement against the black community must stop.  <br><br>
		
		To Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Barr, and yes, Mr. Trump... I'll offer you this.
		‘Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.’ (George Santayana-1905).  Perhaps it is time that those who have sworn to uphold the law and choose to break it are held accountable.  Maybe then, the remaining 800,000 police officers will know the consequences for comitting murder in broad daylight.
		
		<br><br>R.I.P. George Floyd, Your legacy has only begun!<br><br>
