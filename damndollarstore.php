It's a !%*@^ shame that we're not the only ones that like going to the dollar store to pick up our chips, drinks, meds, and cosmetics.  It looks like that rats like shopping there too.  <a href = "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/19/rodent-infestation-leads-to-recalls-at-more-than-400-family-dollar-stores.html">Various news outlets</a> have released information regarding an ongoing investigation of Family Dollar which apparently had a distribution center in Arkansas with an infestation problem so bad that they are having to shut down some 404 locations and recall a littany of products to include human and animal consumables, medication, cosmetics, and more.  Here we are all doing what we can to survive the pandemic not knowing that you might be eating out of a bag of chips that was sitting in rat poop while you were watching the Super Bowl.<br><br>
	It's a sickining thought.  We put a lot of trust in the major store chains which bring us our goods and services.  Had it not been for a hand full of complaints, the FDA's rigor, and an infrastructure with checks and balances, this could have gone one for years.  It's a frightening thought... sharing your food and health care products with rats... yeah your lipstick too.  It was so disturbing, I wanted to know more.  Here's what we found... <br><br><br>
		

	  <a href = "https://www.businessinsider.com/dollar-general-dollar-tree-family-dollar-stores-compared-messy-2019-12">Family Dollar and Dollar Tree are the same folks.</a>  Dollar General is not affiliated with Family Dollar or Dollar Tree.  So, I guess if you get you chips from Dollar General, you might be ok... For me.  I'm done with the damn dollar store.  I hate vermin.  And the thought of rats crawling around my chips before I get them makes me sick.  There's no way someone didn't know what was going on.  It's blatant neglect by a small group of people that don't care about safety.   And now look at what they've done.  They've tarnished one of our favorite places to go.  I'll see yall at Walmart!
