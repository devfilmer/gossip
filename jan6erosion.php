So, what happens once the January 6th hearings end and no one goes to jail?  Would this not be the foundation for more "Civil Disobedience"?  Would this not further incite more people to gather and destroy more government buildings, delay changes in transitions of leadership, and fail to recognize the outcome of the will of the people?  January 6th fundamentally represents the break down of Democracy as a whole.  It demonstrates that after over 200 years of American history, even if the people vote, extremist organizations lead by radical politicians can stage an overthrow of their own government.  <br><br><img src="images/jan62.png" /><br><br>Now, some may believe this is a good thing.  They may believe that eventually, the will of the people will be heard and that justice will prevail.  We all want to believe it.. but nature can teach us all something if we pay attention.  Over time, even a mountain can erode.  Year after year, harsh winds and weather steadily chip away at even the toughest rock.  Layer by layer, bit by bit, year after year.  And believe it or not, as negligible as it may seem, the mountain from 100 years ago is not the mountain that we have today.  Even worst, when you began to blast rock, you weaken the mountain and in some instances, you may even be able to take it down.  <br><br><img src="images/jan63.png" /><br><br>This is the problem with the incidents that took place in Washington D.C. on January 6th.  These so called Americans believed that the election was stolen and saw fit to halt the peaceful transition of power from President Donald Trump to President Joe Biden.  They ignored the results.  They ignored the law.  They ignored the precedent they were setting and they weakened the mountain.  They set off a chain reaction that will be hard to stop.  Now, every election for every seat may be contested.  The people may begin to believe that their votes don't count and that democracy is a figment of your imagination.  They will realize that the hearings were a total waste of the tax payers money whether they revealed the truth or not.  This is a dangerous idea.  It's the kind of thinking that causes people to stay at home on election day.  It's the kind of thinking that causes the wrong types of people to be "elected" and the will of the people cast a way like dust in the wind.

Failure to convince the American people that insurrection of the capital was premeditated and that it was orchestrated by a radical GOP will essentially destroy the authority of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

Failure in the Legislative branch at this juncture will leave an ailing Judicial branch to reinstate order and balance in the midst of an angry mob.';
