    <h1>How the Hell Do You Marry Your Sister?  WTF?</h1>

    <p>Y'all please tell me this is not real.  Is this gross or what? Brothers and sisters getting married are just ridiculous!!! I wonder what kind of environment they were raised in. I wonder if God was part of their belief. Mostly, I'm curious about why and how their attraction began.  This is very abnormal and I feel that it sets a very negative example for the entire world. If laws are being passed where judges can approve this kind of madness, retarded children will be everywhere.<br><br>
The sister is pregnant right now.  Oh my freaking Lord.  Guess what?   They even brought Adam and Eve in their madness.  During ancient Biblical times, the world was being populated.  Men and women lived over 900 years and were having babies.  I guess now we know why they had a hard time keeping God's laws.  Perhaps, they were mentally ill too.<br><br>

All of this is going on in the state of New Jersey. Believe me, I would never want to live there. They have already passed a law for first cousins to marry. Now, a sister/brother scenario - Please!  Then have the nerve to call it legal incestuous relationship and/or marriage.  This is real bad. It will only promote sexual abuse in families, which turns to physical abuse, mental health issues and other sickening laws to be passed in other states as well.  All it takes is one rotten egg.<br><br.
How many agree with me?</p>
