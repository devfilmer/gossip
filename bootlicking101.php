It's like a bad dream watching the Republican's narrow down who they want to represent them.  I have to wonder if it was all scripted from the beginning.  Are you following what I'm saying?  Could it be that there was never going to be anyone other than Mr. Donald Trump as the chosen candidate to represent the Republican Party?  Skeptical?  I remember once hearing that the whole system is rigged as in let's give the people a show and make them think that they actually have a choice about who will be their President.  Does this sound preposterous?  Well, imagine all of the 2024 GOP sitting in a room around February 2023 drawing up what they believe is the greatest show on earth.  They're scratching on their chalk board scenarios of how many candidates they should have?  How many should be minorities?  Who would be believable as real candidates?  What were their real objectives?  Who was going to say what to whom?  How much mud would they sling at each other?  Would Mr. Trump being a borderline outlaw make him more likeable to their base and to the general population?  What could they do to galvanize the mob (The American People) to rally behind their true leader, a man that doesn't have to answer to anyone.... A man that can say just about anything to anyone anywhere even if it's not true, make you laugh, and get away with it.... A man that it is hard to not follow... just so you can see how he's going to tear something up.  <br><br>

Oh, I know, I know, I know.  You don't want to believe that the whole campaign trail was a charade.  You don't want to believe that all of them sat down and scripted out the ugly things they were going to say to one another.  You certainly don't believe that this entire set of debates was simply hog wash... But just for a moment... What if it was?  The tell tell signs are right there in front of us.  We just don't want to accept it.  It's hiding in plain sight.  Here's an example.  How many of the 2024 GOP candidates said horrendous things about Mr. Trump only to turn around and endorse his candidacy?  Mr. Ramaswamy called Mr. Trump a "sore loser" for not accepting his loss in 2020.  He also accused Mr. Trump of making false promises for not repealing Obamacare.  Then, as if someone had a voodoo doll controlling him, Mr. Ramaswamy drops out after the Iowa Caucus and calls Mr. Trump and endorses him.  It was like, huh, what just happened?  <br><br>

Senator Tim Scott can't get off the hook.  He criticized Mr. Trump about his views regarding abortion, his comments about Mr. Netanyahu, and even stated that he once sat with Mr. Trump and had a difficult conversation regarding race.  And yet, he hopped faster than a kangaroo to jump on the Trump band wagon after dropping out of the presidential race.  His endorsement of Mr. Trump in Concord, New Hampshire was nothing short of scandalous.  <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af0vFx-QEek">Click here to see it!</a> This kind of boot licking should be illegal.  It's actually painful to watch.  If I didn't know any better, he wants to be Vice President.  I ain't never seen no shucking and jiving this bad in my entire life.  Shame on you Senator Scott.  Shame on you.<br><br>

There might be some out there offended by this commentary.  Look, I can't make this stuff up.  It's out there.  It's just unfortunate that Spoiled Pickle has to bring it to your attention.  There's been plenty said by both Mr. Desantis and Ms. Haley.  But for now, I just want to point out the trend.  Follow the sitcom script which is throw as much mud as you can to get everyone watching the debates and primaries, then, drop out and support the only candidate there ever was, Mr. Donald J. Trump.  Congradulations Mr. Trump, you're well on your way now.  We're enjoying the show!  Members log in here for more on this article... specifically our prediction for who will be... President Of The United States.

It is almost like the best writers in Hollywood got together and said lets make Mr. Trump into this radical Paul Revere gangstar fighting the good fight and not afraid to say anything to anybody.  And secretly, we all love it.  Shame on us.  Why not go ahead and say it out loud.  It has been the greatest show on earth.  Mr. Trump is about to be reelected President Of The United States.
