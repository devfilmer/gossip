		Sometimes it's good to stop what you are doing and really take time out to analyze what's going on around you.  This is especially important when you consider the restrictive environment that the COVID-19 atmosphere has imposed on the world.  Some are walking around thinking how the world was just perfect before the coronavirus stole away our freedom.  Well, I don't know about that.  We can take a short trip to Flint City, Michigan and watch their attempts to mediate their local issues in September, 2019 and come to a few truly enlightening conclusions.   <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Americanvoicesthedailycaller/videos/539012890154949/">Please take the video below for a quick spin and come then let's get into the rest of this article....</a>... <br><br>
		This has got to be one of the most ridiculous public meetings held by actual elected officials I've ever seen.  But in Flint City, I guess this is the norm.  You can actually review a couple of their gatherings and bear witness to a First Class Circus that's worthy to compete with the Jerry Springer Show.  It's top notch enterainment with absolutely zero substance and zero chance that something productive actually takes place.  I honestly believe the people who show up at this point are there to be entertained.<br><br>

		And what about after the onset of the Coronavirus around March, 2020?  Do you think things changed in Flint, Michigan... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7az3uRx09A">Well, It certainly looks like business as usual to me.</a> So much for social distancing.  It's a damn shame Mr. Eric Mays has not been nominated for an Acadmemy Award.  This man has been at the center of the Flint City Spectacle for years... And when it comes to butting heads, he never dissappoints.  There's no way you're going to watch Mr. Mays without being entertained... and the funny part is, he's dead serious about whatever it is he's debating. I just wonder if there is any other way to get his point across without all the animation.... Well, I guess not.  <br><br>
		
		Point of Order, Flint City Council... maybe it would be a good idea to turn off the cameras at your gatherings to prevent your deliberations from becoming a source of laughter on youtube.  This may even cause less desire by would be serious presenters from acting a fool when they get their time at the microphone.  Maybe it's time to shake out the rug in Flint and just start all over with new people at the reigns... You know what, don't do that...  I don't want to miss the entertainment.  Just keep doing what you do.  It's very entertaining.<br><br>
