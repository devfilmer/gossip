    <h1>Where Do These People Come From?</h1>

   Folks, I just have to ask you a question.  Where do these people come from?  What people you ask?  I’m talking about people like Candice Owens, Ron Johnson, Greg Glassman, Rev. Moloney,  Michael Henkel, and Karel Minor.  I’m sure this is not an all inclusive list. You may be asking yourself what do all these people have in common.  Well, all of them have said disparaging remarks about George Floyd or Black Lives Matter after George Floyd’s death.  It’s unbelievable that in this day and age, we have this kind of toxic insensitivity.  Notice I didn’t call it racism.  It may be something even worse.  What could be worst than racism you ask.  Well, imagine people so insensitive that when someone dies, they have no sense of empathy for the person or the family they leave behind... Imagine being so insensitive that they were capable of attacking a George Floyd’s character after a cold, heartless detainment that resulted in his death.<br><br>

This is a discussion that must take place with as many people as possible.  It’s a discussion about decency, humanity, insensitivity, fairness, and justice.  It’s about what’s right and what’s wrong.  When someone dies as a result of police brutality, murder, captivity, or from any unjust  cause, there’s no room to attack their character after they have passed.  When you do that, you’ve unconsciously justified a wrongful death and you paint yourself as insensitive... and in this case, some may even believe you may be racist.  This is a hard conversation.  It’s uncomfortable.  It’s irregular and yet it may be the only way to help someone understand that when you attack a person who is already dead, you’re not hurting them.  You’re hurting those they left behind.  You’re unconsciously destroying their legacy.  You’re tarnishing their name... and who carries that name... their spouses, their siblings, their parents, their children, and their loved ones.<br><br>

Giving families time to grieve, time to refocus, and time to heal is a part of decency.  This is something that must be taught.  And the only way to teach it is to actually do it.  It’s not hard.  When someone dies, instead of focusing on the negative things you think about the person, focus on those they leave behind.  Think about their children... about their parents.... and maybe just maybe, you won’t say something that is offensive, insensitive, and unwarranted. <br><br>

I’m sorry... but since the dead can’t speak, someone must, and will speak on their behalf.  Candice Owens comments about George Floyd were cruel, mean, and senseless... it’s unimaginable that after watching a man be killed by the police she could utter the words she spoke.  <a href = "https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/candace-owens-gofundme-george-floyd-1234627289/">No wonder your go fund me page got suspended!</a>  Ron Johnson, with your position and status, <a href = "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53025305">your caustic remarks</a> tarnished your company’s brand and were hurtful to everyone.  It\'s hard to believe this is the same Ron Johnson that used to work for Disney and Nickelodeon.  This is supposed to be one of the good guys.  The focus of the George Floyd incident is not on his reputation, his police record, or anything about his life.  The focus is on POLICE BRUTALITY Dude!  Wake up and watch the video.  I\'m sure you have plenty of time now to do it..... And now Drum Role Please..... Hey Mr. Glassman, how are you doing?  I\'m not sure how you became a CEO but I love Cross Fit... They\'re a Top Notch Brand but I find it hard to believe you said "We’re not mourning for George Floyd – I don’t think me or any of my staff are".... Holy $!kx56HYt, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/10/greg-glassman-crossfit-ceo-resigns-george-floyd-protest-coronavirus-tweets-conspiracy-theories">Did you really say that on top of some other ridiculous comments about opening your gym while this COVID-19 is killing folks left and right...</a> Man, you scored twice!  Insensitive and Irresponsible!  And then there\'s the Good Reverend... Rev. Moloney... So let me get this straight, you\'re serving as a the Chaplain at the Massachussets Institute of Technology (MIT), one of the most prestigious Educational Facilities in the World and somehow <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/mit-chaplain-asked-to-resign-over-comments-about-killing-of-george-floyd/32889947#">you , a reverend, said disparaging remarks about George Floyd.<a>  So, we can\'t even pray about it without hearing something ugly in the church about a man who was killed.  Reverend Moloney\'s remarks were enough to make any student skip a few Sundays at church.... Damn, hold the phone... Here comes another one!  <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/philly-court-supervisor-fired-after-removing-signs-saying-black-lives-n1231287">Michael Henkle</a>, I can\'t repeat what you said.  It\'s hurtful.  It\'s painful.  It\'s Ironic!  It\'s Bull.  You\'re a Family Court Supervisor for crying out loud... But I guess none of us should be surprised because this kind of insensitivy is being taught/joked about... <a href="https://www.fox43.com/article/news/local/lancaster-county/head-of-humane-pennsylvania-placed-on-leave-following-outcry-over-facebook-comment-referencing-george-floyd/521-4b0eef5d-9c5a-471a-963f-4aace5a85dec">Right Karel.</a>  Yeah Mr. Minor, president of the Owen J. Roberts School Board and <a href="https://humanepa.org/what-is-hpa/hsbc-staff/">President and CEO of Humane Pennsylvania.</a>  Our leaders need to take a real hard look in the mirror.  They need to understand that they represent the people they serve.  They have to be sensitive to all people and have the presence of mind to realize that some things we just can\'t joke about.  And we can\'t justify the brutal crime of police brutality by judging a man.  That\'s not how it\'s suppossed to work.  Ultimately none of these individual committed the actual crime that resulted in Floyd\'s death.  But they are guilty of insensitivity, callousness, and negligence.<br> <hr style="height: 5px" color="#C75000">';
