After several attacks on US naval vessels in international waters by the Houthis and the interdiction of commercial vessels, the United States and United Kingdoms responded with coordinated attacks on various targets on Yemen soil.  In laymans terms, the US and United Kingdom retaliated with deadly force.  The background story to this response is quite unsettling and really took shape when America was openly threatened by leaders of the Houthis that attacks on their land would be met with retaliation.  It is clear that it is only a matter of time before something may actually happen on US soil.  While America continues to go about its daily routines watching reality TV, football, MMA, and half a dozen other things that blind them, there is an enemy who has made it clear of its intentions.  Just as America has made it clear of what it will not tolerate.  The clock is now ticking.  Will there be a chance at diplomacy or will this be the next minor war American troops will find themselves knee deep in.  One thing is for sure.  It appears the world has a short memory.  Attacks on US soil have always resulted in galvanizing the American people.  It has always resulted in the American people setting aside their differences and focusing on those who dared to destroy their infrastructure.  
<br><br>

<br><br>

Sadly, the proximity of Yemen to Russia and all of Europe poses an issue with their being instability and war all over the world.  How long is it going to take America to realize...  The world is at war.... And yes, now unfortunately America may be at war.  There are around 32 million people in Yemen who are looking at the west differently.  They now know America will strike.  Do they blame the Houthis or do they blame America's leadership?  The Houthis have stated that their drone attacks on American naval vessels was due to America's cooperation with Israel as it continues to bombard the Gaza strip.  There is no way America can now deny what side they are on.  The media can shine the light on Palestinian Americans and those fighting for America's leaders to cease and desist from its support of Israel's destruction of Gaza.  However, destruction from both the United Kingdom and the US has now taken place on Yemen soil.  You can't take it back.  It's done.  The whole world saw it.  Americans can be divided all they want with regard to the action that was taken.  The war has begun.  Yemen is now America's enemy.<br><br>


<br><br>So, what happens now?  How many more attacks will take place in Yemen?  Will America's leadership entertain Russian leadership to broker peace in Yemen?  Doubtful!  You can't just shoot missiles at someone, blow up a bunch of stuff and expect them to be friendly the next day.  It is like a bad dream unfolding slowly each day... climbing slowly to a climax where the unthinkable becomes reality... dreadful violence born on violence... blood for blood... strangers killing strangers that could have been friends.
