    <h1>Is There Any Pizza Place That Doesn't Suck?</h1>

   </p>

		Everybody knows that America loves pizza.  But, everyone also knows that Americans are extremely opinionated and when it comes to pizza, everybody hates somebody's pizza.  So the question is, "Is there any pizza out there that no one has said something bad about?  That's what I wanted to know.  Can I find one pizza out there that no one has said sucks?  So, as I began my delicious research, I stumbled across numerous pizza joints I'd never heard of.  It was an incredible journey that left my mouth watering to find out the truth.  Is there a pizza that doesn't suck.  At first, I did a sporadic web search to find what I believed to be the most popular pizza businesses out there.  Soon, I discovered there was really no definitive list.  Everybody has a list and there's no shortage.  So, in an attempt to try to narrow down the research, I decided to take a more discerning approach.  I asked who out there has attempted to find the best pizza?  As luck would have it, I stumbled upon a site called <a href="https://www.pizzatoday.com/pizzeria-rankings/2019-top-100-pizza-companies/">Pizza Today which publishes a list of the top 100 pizza companies each year.  </a> I decided that this may be the best place to narrow down which pizza places I would research to determine if I could find at least one that no one has said anything bad about. <br><br>   
Now, I'm going to try very hard not to be bias.  After all, my opinion has nothing to do with this.  This is about what people took time out to say on the internet.  It's about people who were upset enough about a pizza place's product or service that they took time out to say something about it.  So without further ado, let's delve into the various slices and see if we can find just one that hasn't earned the this pizza sucks accolade.<br><br>
Let's start with the big dog.  That's right! Domino's Pizza, the king of pizza delivery.   As you may have guessed it, when you are this big, you're bound to have someone out there that hates you.  Some people hate the pizza.  Others hate their service.  The truth is that if Dominos had not come along, many of the food delivery services we enjoy today may never have come to pass. But alas, that's not what this article is about.  It's about people's opinions.  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/318700/dominos-pizza-sucks-so-why-cant-anyone-else-top-their-tech/">Sorry dominos, you've got haters.</a><br><br>
Hey Papa John's, I said I wasn't going to be biased.  So, I'm really biting my tongue here.  And it's taking everything in me to not say what I really want to say.  <a href ="https://markweinguitarlessons.com/forums/threads/why-does-everyone-hate-papa-johns-pizza-so-much-is-it-a-hipster-thing.74227/">So, I'll let these folks say it for me.  </a>Yeah, there are those that feel Papa John's just doesn't cut the mustard and we won't even bother talking about the founder and his woes.  It's a damn shame... all of it.<br><br>
I was driving through Tallahassee, Florida once and saw a place called Hungry Howie's Pizza. It was lit up like Christmas and looked like it might just be the bomb.  Well, I wish I had stopped to check it out.  But that's not what this article is about is it.  <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42365-d4637945-r456062433-Hungry_Howie_s_Pizza-Kimball_Michigan.html">Yeah Howie, you got haters.</a><br><br>
Little Caesars Pizza... <a href="https://www.ign.com/boards/threads/lets-be-honest-for-a-moment-little-caesars-is-the-worst-pizza-chain.454962055/">You know what's coming so don't act like you don't know.</a><br><br>
Now I just can't stand having to say this.  I grew up on Pizza Hut pizza... And I have to tell you that I.... it.  I'm not going to break my rule.  This is not about my opinion.  <a href ="https://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3789313">I'm sorry Pizza Hut, someone out there hates you.</a><br><br>
Yes, California Pizza Kitchen <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-California-Pizza-Kitchen-RVW13977632.htm">someone hates you.</a><br><br>
Sbarro's Pizza.  You guessed it... <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55229-d4181884-r322202346-Sbarro-Nashville_Davidson_County_Tennessee.html">Yeah, someone hates them.</a><br><br>
Ok, I didn't believe this one.  Yep that right, even Uno Pizzeria.  <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60811-d439107-r201705167-Uno_Pizzeria_Grill-Baltimore_Maryland.html">You've got haters.<a><br><br>
Chuck E. Cheese.  You knew this was coming. <a href="http://www.doubletheadventure.com/2008/08/why-i-hate-chuck-e-cheese.html">There you go.</a><br><br>
Papa Murphy's <a href="https://youtu.be/XkPwaeCNtJY">You knew someone had to hate you.</a><br><br>
Hey Marco's, <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g50266-d4656704-r587863681-Marco_s_Pizza-Defiance_Ohio.html">believe it or not someone hates you.</a><br><br>
Round Table Pizza, <a href="http://www.customerservicescoreboard.com/Round+Table+Pizza">You've got customer service issues.</a><br><br>
MOD Pizza, <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanlftw/status/582984136312291328">Someone hates you.</a><br><br>
Jet's Pizza, <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g54955-d5095069-r512241242-Jet_s_Pizza-Clarksville_Tennessee.html">Someone hates you too.</a><br><br>
Blaze Pizza, I'm sorry Lebron. <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g54955-d5095069-r512241242-Jet_s_Pizza-Clarksville_Tennessee.html">This guy doesn't like the price.</a><br><br>
Old Chicago Pizza, <a href="https://slice.seriouseats.com/2011/11/chicago-trying-and-failing-to-uncover-a-hidden-gem.html">Someone even has a problem with you.</a><br><br>
God Father's Pizza, <a href="http://naafa.blogspot.com/2014/11/godfathers-pizza-sucks.html">Sorry!</a><br><br>
Pizza Ranch, <a href="https://foursquare.com/v/pizza-ranch/5075b62be4b0f61cb8eda19e">Oh boy.</a><br><br>
Rosati's Pizza, <a href="https://www.restaurantji.com/in/dyer/rosatis-pizza-dyer-/">Pizza good, service bad?</a><br><br>
I think this will be the last one I look at.  Mellow Mushroom, save us! <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35348-d4543636-r262066545-Mellow_Mushroom-Warner_Robins_Georgia.html">Nope!</a><br><b>
Dag Gum!  I'm willing to bet that if I look through every single one of the top 100 pizza companies, I'm not going to find one that doesn't have either a complaint about their product or a complaint about their service. Maybe the world is just filled with whiners.  Maybe, no one can get it right every time, all the way across the board, food and service.  May folks just want to complain.  Maybe no one really likes pizza.<br><br>
