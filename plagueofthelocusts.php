		Can you imagine living deep within the African Continent, sowhere like the Sudan where locust plagues are common?  Can you imagine locusts ravaging your nations food supply?  Well, this is exactly what is currently going on in Africa.  Hundreds of thousands of African people are now facing locust plagues that threaten to destroy the baseline of their grains, vegetables, and other critical crops.  Though there are means available for some of the countries to deal with the pests, many have no programs in place.  Couple this with travel restrictions, poverty, and an unsettled future for living in a Coronavirus environment and you have the makings of a potential starvation epidemic on top of the coronavirus pandemic.  <br><br>

		When the locusts come, they destroy everything... And there really is no starting over.  Many of these crops can take from two to three months to harvest.  When a crop is wiped out, it's gone and now some other means of providing sustinence for the people must be found.  African nations have historically struggled with territorial violence, poverty, economic challenges, starvation, and illness.  However, Africa and the world for that matter has never dealt with a pandemic of this magnitude... The coronavirus will force nations to have to collaborate to erradicate it.  But in the meantime, thousands will suffer from the second and third order effects.  Economies will suffer, industry will suffer, businesses will suffer, and it . appears now that the poverty stricken innocent will suffer.

		In fact, wild fires are now sweeping the Amazon Jungles unchecked because of the coronavirus.  Again, this is due in part because of personel shortages, social distances, and other economic factors.  Even scarier is what it really means to Earth's environment as a whole.  <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/08/28/amazon-rain-forest-what-would-earth-like-without-it/2130430001/">Presently, living beings on Earth produce 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year.</a> The Amazon jungles absorbs 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year which is  5% of annual emissions.  The idea that within 10 years, <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/lifestyle/tech/494258/amazon-rainforest-is-nearly-full-of-greenhouse-gases-and-could-start-polluting-earth-in-next-15-years/">the Amazon jungles will no longer be absorging CO2, but actually adding to the CO2 produced because of fires ripping through the forest unchecked is real.</a>  Is is plausible to believe that threats like the coronavirus which stifle human intervention by preventing them from working together with concentrated effort could possible result in climate change issues that are irreversible?  Is it possible that if we do not get the coronavirus in check, it will be devestating to not just the African continent but to Earth as a whole because of food shortages?  <br><br>
		
		While the world races to find a vaccine for the coronavirus, the locusts have already arrived.
