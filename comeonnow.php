		Ok, I get it.  Everyone is angry about the coronavirus.  It's dominating the conversation.  It's redefined our existence.  It's pissed everyone off.  It's threatening our lives and the lives of our loved ones.  Yeah, I agree, it freaking sucks... but we got to be real.  Some time on 24 April, 2020, The President conducted a public conference regarding efforts that are underway to determine possible methods of combatting the Coronavirus.  Sitting aptly to his right to support his speech, Dr. Birx appeared astutely ready to support him at a moments notice.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wcQYA-ol_A">The President clearly conveyed detailed how tests involving sunlight to kill the virus are currently being conducted.</a>  
		
		<br><br>
		<img src = "images/comeon/comeon3.png"/>
		<br><br>
		 Then, President Trump further discussed how disinfectants have been shown to kill the corona virus within one minute.  He then attempted to pitch the idea that maybe there are methods that could cleanse the body by injecting disinfectants to kill the virus...  He then looked to Dr. Birx for some form of acknoledgement... But, hey, she kind of sat there and didn't seem to agree or disagree.  Then came the spin...   
		
		
		I don't know why people do this, but they do.  They take what we say and they twist it... And when it comes to world leaders, depending on where the polls are at the moment, they tend to twist the words in the cruelest way they can to crust the leader.  They want to take the topic and change it from the issue at hand to the person delivering the message.  It's like have you ever had a conversation with someone who just sits there not listening to a word you say then as soon as you stop talking, they seem to lock in on something you said, twist it, take it out of context, then blare it as loud and vicerally as they can.  It's like that was there only intent.  They weren't listening.  They were not trying to have an intelligent conversation.  They wanted to have an argument.  They want to bring shame and blame on your name.  It's straight up hate and it's really just flat out unproductive... That's right.  I said it.  It's unproductive!<br><br>
		
		If you've got beef with Mr. Trump, make sure it's based on fact.  Make sure when he has the podium, you listen carefully... Don't listen with the intent of just twisting the man's words.  It's unproductive.  Don't sit there and imply that he told people to drink clorox, because he didn't. Listen to him again.  He's trying to coach these scientists to explore every possiblity.

		While we are in the midst of this pandemic, there's no room for changing the topic from the virus to Mr. Trump's choice of words during a speech.  There's no room for twisting anyone's words.  We're wasting ink on bull crap.  Let's focus on what work is being done at <a href="https://news.emory.edu/stories/2020/03/coronavirus_vteu_modernastart/index.html">Emory University regarding the COVID-19 virus.</a>  Let's focus on <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/coronavirus-pandemic-climate-change/">how the coronavirus is effecting climage change.</a>  Let's focus on how <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/10/asia/coronavirus-food-supply-asia-intl-hnk/index.html">the coronavirus is affecting the world's food supply.</a>  Let's focus on how we can defeat this beast.  We don't have time for anything else.  <br><br>
