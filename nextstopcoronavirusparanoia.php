		 <br><br>
		It's Thursday, March 12, 2020.  A few weeks back, if you had a chance to read our commentary on the Coronavirus, you may remember that <a href= "http://spoiledpickle.com/coronavirus1.php">we said folks were not telling the truth about the virus</a> and that it had to be much worse than what is being tracked and relayed to the general public.  Now here we are on March 12, 2020.  President Trump has suspended travel to the US from Europe.  The NBA has suspended its season.  Folks are fighting over Clorox wipes and toilet paper.  Everyone is talking about telework.  The stock market took a nose dive.  Crypto markets took a hit.  Altercations are taking place between passengers on public transportation regarding the virus.  <a href = "https://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshh0z2lpL3SwkbJNiuR">Folks are trying to make Coronavirus protection gear out of plastic garbage bags and head gear from Walmart bags.</a>  
<br> <br>
		So, what’s next?  It’s obvious.  Panic and paranoia, <a href= "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/coronavirus-map-tracking-spread-us-world/story?id=69415591">more sickness</a>, increasing economic losses, bankruptcy, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/03/live-coronavirus-map-used-to-spread-malware/">increased criminal activity</a>, and yes, increased violent crimes in the name of protecting ones self.  There will be some claiming they had to steal because they had no other options.  They’ll claim they did it to survive.  There will be big fights over petty items... toilet paper, cleaning items, the last pack of hot dogs, canned goods, and yes ... even bar soap.  If you cough on someone on the subway and they think it was a hostile act, you could catch an ass whooping.  The point is that normal day to day interactions with people are about to change.

<br><br>
There is a possibility of mass temporary closings of all public gathering places... this includes schools, work facilities, churches, and shopping areas.   There may be a lock down internally regarding travel from city to city.  We may find ourselves marooned in our own homes... captives in our own neighborhoods.  It will be a surreal experience for many especially when they find out their neighbors have Coronavirus.  Now, they may never want to visit their homes again.  They may be fearful of speaking to them in person... or even coming in contact with their pets.
<br><br>
This is a serious moment in our nations history.  The Coronavirus threatens the very fabric of our society.  When people no longer gather to communicate, work, worship, or socialize and when they become both economically and physically constrained, bad shit happens.  When there is no longer trust between individuals and people begin fighting over trivial items, it sets the baseline for further fracturing of our communities.  No one is exempt from the carnage.  The DOW Jones Industrial Average tumbled 2000 points while Bitcoin lost 40% of its value in one day.  It’s a horrible crisis that has only begun to mature.  <br><br>
