	Here we are again... Can you believe it?  It's November 2020, Thanksgiving is around the corner... The Coronavirus is still raging.... and the Presidential election is over... Or is it?  After all the craziness of the Trump Presidency, we just can't seem to escape the foolishness even now that the electoral college has ruled that Joe Biden has won.  It's like damn man, can't you read the screen?  The people have chosen who they want to their next President.  I mean, when you won... you said that the process had worked the way it should work.  When you lost, now you screaming voter fraud... You're filing law suits.  You won't concede.  You won't start the transition.  You won't accept that maybe people are tired of the the Clown Show.  Let me give you hint.  Even Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus went out of business.   <br><br>

People are tired of the drama.  No one wants to hear any more about the women who have claimed to have been harassed.  No one wants to see you not wearing a mask and claiming that the Pandemic is a hoax.  No one wants to see a foreign policy that brought us to the brink of another world war.  No one wants see the Chinese Tariff Show any more.  No one wants to the see the Trump Pelosi Impeachment Gun Smoke Show, or the Trump Guiliani Show, or the Trump Ivanka Trump Jr. Show, or the Trump vs African American Show, or the Trump Firing Everybody on the Planet Show any more.  <br><br>

 ... And it's not like this hasn't happened before.  There have been other contested elections.  I'll spare the details in this commentary.  Read more  <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-history-of-contested-presidential-elections-from-samuel-tilden-to-al-gore-149414">here.</a>  In all the cases where Presidential elections have been contested, no one has ever won.  No one.  Dude... No one.  So, the moral of the story is... don't lose.  Once they say you have lost, you've lost.  Once the media broadcast that you aren't the winner, you might as well go home.  But what do I know?  I know that while the America was in the middle of the Black Lives Matter movement and while America was watching the Koreans lob missiles in the air, and while over two dozen women were complaining about the President, and while America was paying for a wall that will now never be finished, and while the press was running out of ink writing about who got fired this week, and while Civil Rights Leaders were crying foul all over America, Mr. President, you were tweeting on the toilet. <br><br>

Mr. Biden... Mrs. Harris... Congratulations.... Please don't give me as much to write about as Mr. Trump... It was exhausting.
