It seems like a lifetime ago that Mr. Bill Cosby went to jail for allegedly drugging and raping women.  No one wanted to believe it but he was convicted.  He went to prison.  He did time and now somehow some kind of way, it's been overturned.  Have you listened to the reporters, read any of the articles concerning this issue?  I just can't understand what is really going on.  If the man was convicted of these crimes, isn't he guilty?   Shouldn't he serve his full sentence?  If the courts have overturned his case, does that mean he was not guilty?  Does this mean that he should never have gone to jail in the first place?  Shall I keep going?  Well, the truth is it's starting to look like this was a big money grab.   <br><br>

Think about it.  If this man is not guilty, why did you put him in jail?  You've taken everything from Mr. Cosby.  You've ripped his syndicated shows off of cable.  You've destroyed his reputation.  You've put him in jail.  You've accussed him of being one of the worst things a man can be accused of, a rapist.  He has lost friends, credentials, family support and virtually his entire following.  How much money did the lawyers and the courts get while destroying this man?  How much money did the women get from the lawsuits?  And what happens now.   The man looks like he can't even see.  It appears he is being led by handlers from one destination to the next.  All the while, the lawyers and the protecters are just cashing in.  <br><br>

It's a damn shame.  And I can't stand it.  Is the man a rapist or is he the one being raped? </p>
