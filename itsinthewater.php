It never ceases to amaze me how little things can tell us so much... Like what just happened in a small New Jersey mall where two teen age boys, one black, one white, ended up in an argument and began to scuffle.  Nothing new here... just two boys fighting over something I'm sure wasn't worth fighting about.  All too often, there first course of action is to begin shoving and then punches soon follow... But that's not the worse of it.  No, I don't believe they should solve their issues with fist to cuffs.  No, I don't advocate violence to solve problems... whether it's children or adults... but what really bothers me is how the cops handled the situation.

Don't get me wrong.  I'm glad they were there and executed their duties swiftly and broke up the fight before someone was seriously injured.  It's just how they executed their duties that bothers me.  Why is it that the black teen was thrown to the ground, knees pressed to his back, and then cuffed while the white teen was simultaneously told to sit on the couch.  Almost humorously, the white teen stuck his wrists in the air as if he wanted to be cuffed.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe he felt left out... But why was there a difference in how they were treated?  Look, I watched the fight.  No one was winning.  I think the white teen was actually even bigger.  Did they feel more threatened because there was a young black man fighting to protect himself?  Why were they not equally as threatened by the white teen.  Let's get the facts straight.  Oh yeah, I'm not going to leave anything out from what I saw.  Both cops were white.  Did that have something to do with it?  Maybe it's standard operating procedure for the New Jersey Police to put the black man on the ground and let the white man sit and explain what why they were doing what ever it is they were doing.  I'm just trying to understand.

Wait a minute... I know what it is.  It's in the water.  That's the only explanation I can come up with after Rodney King, Amaud Arbery, George Floyd, and so many others.  It's got to be in the water.  The Civil Rights Movement is Over.  Isn't it?  We've had black president.  We have equal rights.  We all have the right to vote.  Everyone is on an equal footing, right.  Then why is it that black people time and time again are treated differently in the court room, differently in corporate America, differently in the classroom, differently on the football field, differently at the grocery store, differently at the restaurants, differently at the post office, differently at the museum, differently every where they go... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDD6IzCejc">even at the Bridgewater Mall in New Jersey</a>....
