It's just one of those things.<br><br>

Every day we get another opportunity to squeeze the best out of life if we're lucky.  And one of the things that brings many of us joy is having the chance to eat incredible food.  But what makes food special?  Some equate it to who actually is doing the cooking.  Others think it's about secret recipes that might have been handed down from generation to generation.  Still others think it's about exotic vittles that have been carefully obtained without a care for the cost or have been prepared in some manner that is just far too expensive for common folk.. But there's one truth that all of these folks can agree on.  Some people know how to barbecue... And Some people don't. <br><br>

I've seen all kinds try their hand at barbecue only to come up with burn't meat that they proudly shove in their throats and swear that they've mastered the art knowing full well their mouths taste like lighter fluid and they've got the flavor of burnt chicken filling their nostrils.  Worse yet, they make the same mistakes over and over and over again... and usually no one has the heart to tell they, hey yo... "Your food sucks!" But once it happens, they are heart broken and then that's when they get serious.  That's when they start watching videos on YouTube to learn more about how to do it the right way... That's when they start investing in expensive equipment.  That's when they start looking at those Traeger Grills and buying what looks like bird seed to cook with... Usually, their skills improve and there is a lot less ugliness from their food samplers but they never really get down to really mastering the art... <br><br>

Mastery of cooking and preparing barbecue takes time.  It takes patience.  And it takes experience.  You only gain this over time.  You have to change the way you look at things ... What am I talking about you might be asking.  I'm talking about changing your lifestyle and realizing that in order to get better at the art of cooking, you have to practice.  Every opportunity you get, you need to cook.  You need to try different things.  And you can't be inhibited by the weather, your schedule or how cold it is outside.  All of these things are part of learning what it takes to make the perfect barbecue in any situation.  The environment changes... So, how you build your fire changes.  It's raining.  So what!  How do you conquer the rain and still make your barbecue.  This is the mentality you have to have if you want to master the art of barbecue.  You must be relentless in your pursuit of perfection.  You have to study it.  You have to pay attention to the details...  What kind of wood am I using?  How far from the fire is the meat?  How do you prep the meat?  What is the internal temperature of my meat when it is fully cooked?  How should I season the meat?  What are the things that will absolutely ruin my cook?  <br><br>

Once you begin to look at the world in this way... your food will change 100%.  You will weed out the average concoctions and only settle for the best.  You will know exactly how much wood and what type of wood you need and the things you need to do to prepare the meat in order to make the smoke get all the way to the bone.  It's up to you.  If you want to be good... You can be good.  But if you want to be great...  then you're going to have to put in alot more effort.<br>br>  To learn more about how this pork loin was cooked to perfection while it was 44 degrees fahrenheit outside...

The fire was litterally two feet and one half feet from the meat.  The initial start of the fire did flame up and lick the fat on the bottom of the loin.  The loin was basted in mustard and then covered with a generous amount of lemon pepper and season salt.  The wood used was red oak and pecan wood.  The red oak was presplit and sat out for at least two months.  The fire was never brought more than two feet from the meat as logs were added. The meat was stationed on the grill for four hours before removing and aloud to rest for 15 minutes.
