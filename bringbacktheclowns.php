    I will never forget the raid on the capitol. It was a day that will forever sit painfully in my mind... hundreds of so called patriots looting their own capitol on national television, exacting violence against law enforcement, while elected officials ran for cover, hid, and did nothing.... And to top it off, it was instigated by our own law makers... and may have been incited by the President of the United States.  For veterans and for those who currently serve in defense of this nation, this moment will forever be a point of confusion... Since when could a delusional mob take the streets, raid the capitol, smear fecal matter in it's hallowed chambers and commit numerous acts of vandalism without being contested or held accountable.  They smashed windows, hung from the door jams, smeared fecal matter, trampled furniture, and defaced the walls of the most sacred symbol of democracy on the planet.  And yet, somehow, the police and the national guard were not on the scene to stop this barbarism.  <br>
    <img src="images/capitol2.jpeg"/><br><br>
    And where was the president?  Was he watching?  Was he happy with what he would be accused of instigating?  Still there were others... Senators and congressional representatives who participated in rallies that led up to this event.  The part that really bothers me is in the aftermath of whole thing, there were those who did not see the grounds for the president's impeachment.  How could you participate in something like this and call yourself American.  You literally defaced the symbol of democracy.  The images were disturbing to say the least.  The comments by the mob were even more disturbing... people chanting, screaming, yelling, and looting.  Were they angry because Mr. Trump didn't get re-elected?  Why were they angry?  <br><br>
    <img src="images/capitol3.jpeg"/><br><br>
    And then there was the next day.... we got to see what America's tax dollars get wasted on... hundreds of national guard members in and around the capitol... and oh yea, they would have to remain in place until after Mr. Biden was sworn in.  So if we go back to the beginning of this incident, we can see that it was forged for one simple purpose... and that was to disrupt the recognition of a newly elected president... and to demonstrate that there is a faction within this country that does not respect their own Constitution.  This faction believes that they own America... and everyone in it.  They believe they are entitled to the land, the jobs, and the wealth... and this is why they organized themselves to demonstrate what they truly believe... They believe their country has been stolen from them.<br><br>

    Well I got news for you people.  It looks like there's a lot more people that don't believe you own the place.  I got some more news for you too.  It looks like even though America appeared to be fracturing at the seams under the Black Lives Movement, unchecked police brutality, violence, COVID 19, and a president without a conscience, the system worked.  The people elected new leadership.  The people chose decency over kaos.  The people chose purpose over foolishness... So, when it comes time to bring back the clowns to face the music for what they've done, be assured, the system will work again.
