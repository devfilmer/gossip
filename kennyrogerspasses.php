Surely by now you’ve heard the news.  We lost Kenny Rogers… an artist with a voice so big that cut right through all the bull and made you think about what’s important in life.  If you were lucky enough to grow up listening to hits like “Lady”, “Buy Me A Rose”, “Islands in The Stream”, “All My Life”, and “You Decorated My Life”, there’s no way you were not touched by his insightful lyrics and just good old fashioned soulful country music.  <br><br>
It’s almost like while the world was spinning out of control, Kenny found time to leave us with a collection of songs that you can reach back to for encouragement, hope, and a smile.  Truth is, the man couldn’t make a bad song.  Every song he made in my opinion is a hit.  I mean really.  Think about it.  “Don’t fall in love with a dreamer”, “We Got Tonight”, “My Love”…. This guy was a Hit Machine.  <br><br>

But more than that, Kenny was a humanitarian who gave generously to his community.  Through the Kenny Rogers Childrens’s Center, various charities and other efforts committed to improving the human condition, Kenny Rogers has touched us all with both his music and his sincere generosity.  “The Gambler” didn’t go quietly.  He left a message for us all. Every gambler knows that the secret to surviving is knowing what to throw away and knowing what to keep.  Because every hand’s a winner and every hand’s a loser… And the best thing you can hope for is to die in your sleep….  You got to know when to hold ‘em.  Know when to fold ‘em.  Know when walk away. Know when to run.  You never count your money when you’re sitting at the table.  There’ll be time enough for counting when the dealings done.<br><br>

Thanks Kenny… Thanks for gambling on us.  You will be missed.  We’ll see you again. </p>
