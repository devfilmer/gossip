		Just when all hope was lost and the pain of the George Floyd killing began to stir unrest around America's biggest cities.  Just when President Trump declares that Antifa is a Terrorist Group responsible for the violence raging around the U.S.. while failing to realize we have civilians running over peaceful protesters and cops running over protesters with their vehicles...  Just when you wonder how many "peaceful protesters" will be classified as "terrorists/Antifa" and suffer the wrath of facing the U.S. Army, the National Guard, and local law enforcement agencies.  Just when you witness American police officers are hitting women in the face during so called peaceful protests.  And just when you see American police officers are being killed in the process.  Just when police precincts, shopping centers, and established businesses are being vandalized and burned by looters.  And right when you begin to wonder, what is going to happen next, a voice cuts through the fog of continued imminent violence with a decent idea...
		And that voice is Rep. Val Demings out of Florida.  <br><br> She has a simple idea.  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/demings-we-are-long-overdue-for-every-law-enforcement-agency-in-our-nation-to-review-itself/ar-BB14QteJ?li=BBnb7Kz">Law enforcement agencies nationwide should conduct internal reviews.</a>  Maybe this will revitalize those government entities who are responsible for overseeing the training of America's police officers. This simple concept would identify the source of deviant methods of interrogation and apprention being utilized by corrupt police officers.  How about that?  A simple idea that just might get the ball rolling to stop racial profiling... A simple idea that might stop violent protests all around the United States by retraining America's police force.... A simple idea that demonstrates empathy towards African Americans while getting at the root of the real problem... A non-sympathetic law enforcement system that treats people like animals instead of people.  This is not racism.  It's an epidemic of inhumanity that was seeded from slavery, fertilized by racism, and propagated by ignorance, hate, and social numbness.  Now the viceral message propagated on social media due to technology being in the hands of the masses it that African Americans are under attack. Minorities and women don't have a voice... And God help you if you get pulled over by the police.  This should not be the relationship between the masses and those chosen to protect them... And the only way to change this paradign.. is to change the paradign.  We have to be able to turn on the news and not see another unarmed black man dead at the hands of some random cop in some random city every week.  We should not be able to change the channel and see a police officer body slamming a woman at Walmart because she wasn't wearing a mask.  We have to not be able to see a woman being hit in the face by a police officer during a protest two weeks later....   <br><br>
		
		Replace insanity with humanity.  Replace ignorance with empathy.  Retrain, rebuild, and learn from the past. 
		
		<br><br>Rep. Val Demings... Please keep fighting the good fight.  I hope someone can hear you.<br><br>
