		I'm sure by now you've seen a few articles regarding the coronavirus... Maybe you've seen a map like the one above showing the countries with confirmed coronavirus cases.  But are you really paying attention to the headlines?  Even more disturbing is the slow sludge like reporting about the epidemic that is sweeping the globe.  We keep hearing about the widespread outbreak in China and how it is potentially affecting their economy.  We hear about isolated cases in the United States, on a cruise ship, and other smaller countries who are desperately searching for a cure.  But are you really paying attention?  <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/10/804387615/china-reports-nearly-100-deaths-in-a-single-day-from-coronavirus">Here is an article citing 1000 deaths due to the coronavirus in China dated 10 February, 2020.</a>  Ok, let's look at another.<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/10/coronavirus-latest-updates.html"> Here's an article dated 10 February stating that the death toll in China is 1,013 and the confirmed number of cases is 42,700 cases.</a>Wait a minute.  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/17/coronavirus-latest-updates-china-hubei.html">Here's another stating the death toll in China is 1770 in China Dated 16 February, 2020</a>  In addition, this article goes on to state that there are some 70,548 confirmed coronavirus cases in China.  <br><br>

		Bill and Melinda Gates are pledging <a href="https://www.wqad.com/article/news/bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation-donating-100-million-to-coronavirus-relief-efforts/526-b2630cbb-8857-4c8c-b4fb-4fb1bdf56411">100 million dollars to coronavirus relief efforts.</a><br>UNICEF says they need 42 million to scale up their operations in order to respond to the corona virus. Apple has stated they will not meet earnings expectations and iPhone demand due to the coronavirus outbreak in China.  <br><br>
		Take a look at this <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200217-sitrep-28-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=a19cf2ad_2">report by the World Health Organization.</a>  It clearly states that in the last 24 hours (16 Feb - 17 Feb), in China alone, there were 106 new deaths and 2051 new cases.  If we take a look at the number stated above, we'll find that in china alone, from 10 Feb - 16 Feb, there were an average of 126 deaths over the course of 6 days, while the number of corona virus cases almost doubled in six days.  <br><br>
		
		<img src = "images/infectedsoldier.jpg"/>
		<br><br>
		For those out there who are somewhat over educated, you should see that a quick plot of the deaths as well as the number of cases over time is almost linear.  I'm going to say that again another way. You can almost plot a line... average of a 100 deaths a day... Does that make since?  Think about it.  Yeah that's right, it doesn't make since... And you know it.  If you have the flu and you sneeze in a room of 30 people, then another with 20, then another with 15, it's not going to be a linear distribution of people effected.  It's going to be either an exponential distribution or a gamma distribution. Ah, ok, what does that mean?  It means that the number of folks that are infected and the number who die form day to day should be going up much much faster... not evenly.  <a href="https://www.ynhhs.org/patient-care/urgent-care/flu-or-coronavirus"> Look at this comparison between influenza and the coronavirus. </a> The symptoms are simular.  But when you look at the perceived threat of influenza vs. the coronavirus, it's somewhat understated.  They mearly state that there have been 15 million cases of influenza in the US verses 15 coronavirus.  They're leaving out that there is not a vaccine available yet to prevent the coronavirus and that no one has announced a cure!  Meanwhile, even though the World Wide Health Organization has classified the coronavirus as an epidemic, <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2020/02/13/us-military-prepping-for-coronavirus-pandemic/"> the United States Military is prepping for a pandemic. 
		</a>  <br><br><img src = "images/infected2.jpg"/><br><br>
		Take a look at <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/difference-between-epidemic-and-pandemic-2615168"> the definitions in this article</a> of endemic, hyperdemic, outbreak, epidemic, and pandemic.  Here's the problem.  If we look at the numbers, you could easily see how someone might classify the "outbreak" of the coronavirus in China as an epidemic.  However, when you consider there is not a "cure" or preventative vaccine available, these definitions suck bad.  As a matter of fact, since the virus has spread to various continents, you could make a case that we are in a potential pandemic crisis.<br><br>
		We're being lied to.  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2Fabout%2Ftransmission.html">Acording to this article, if someone sneezes within six feet of you or you touch a surface that has dropplets of the virus and then somehow inhale it or get it in your mouth, you can get the virus.</a> Does this mean that everthing coming out of the infected areas of China may have been exposed to the coronavirus?  Does this mean that every phone, flower pot, and clothing garment that says made in China and was produced in 2019 or 2020 may be contagious?  Do we all need to get a mask before they are no long available?  Or does it even matter because there are too many things sitting on the shelves at Walmart (70%-80% of their merchandise) that is made in China. Are we doomed?  I don't know but I do know this.  <a href="https://ktla.com/2020/02/16/san-diego-lab-says-it-has-designed-a-vaccine-for-coronavirus/">There are some folks out there claiming to have a vaccine for the coronavirus.</a> And if they do, we need to be cheering for these folks like we cheer for the Kansas City Chiefs at the Superbowl.  We need to be hollering about their progress like we holler about the slam dunk contest or the World Cup.  It's clear that if we're not being lied to, they certainly are not telling us the whole truth.
