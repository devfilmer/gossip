As everyone goes about their business running to and from various destinations to complete both the mundane and essential tasks that make up their activities day in and day out, I find it amazing that when I stopped for gas at an ordinary gas station that there was a face mask laying on the ground right beneath my feet just as I opened my truck door.  I couldn't help but think, so this is what the post COVID-19 era looks like.  Gas prices beginning to head north of $3.00 a gallon... stores full of people but variety is lacking and some things you just can't find.  People are running around thinking that they are immune to everything because they been \"vacccinated\".  Really?  Yeah really.  That's why this mask is on the ground.  The masses are beginning to believe that it's ok to just go back to business as usual.  Get the shot, your're ok is what they think.  But just a little casual research reveals a totally different story. <br><br>
<img src = "images/isthisyourmask/JPEG/IMG_3200.jpg"/><br><br>
I wonder how many people out there are tracking the Delta variant of the coronavirus.  I wonder how many Americans realize that the new Delta variant of the coronavirus is now in all 50 states.  Do they realize that the Delta variant transmits more easily?  Do they realize that this strain of the virus accounts for more that 50% of the new cases of COVID-19?  Do they realize that you can still get the virus even if you are vaccinated?  Do they realize that the Delta variant is more harmful and that today's vaccines are not that effective on the Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus unless you are vaccinated.    <br><br>

So I have to ask the question!  Is this your mask on the ground up here at the gas station?  Is this your mask up here at the grocery store?  Why are you not wearing your mask in public places?  Is it because you are vaccinated and don't believe you can get the virus?  Is is because you think the pandemic is over?  Or is it because you just never wanted to wear the mask in the first place?  Well, the information about the current status of the COVID-19 virus is out there.  Here is a link:  <a href = "https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/#do-fully-vaccinated-people-need-to-wear-masks-because-of-this-delta-strain">Check it out!</a>  Don't say you weren't told.  It is what it is.  There's still alot of reasons to take precautions.... And if something as simple as a mask can stop us from getting sick, maybe we should pick up the sorry mask off the ground and wash it.</p>
