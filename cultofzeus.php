		It is inevitable that those adorned with higher education, higher economic resources, and a highers sense of being will seek to influence their environment utilizing their resources to carry out what they believe is the greater good.  Whether it be out of a lust for power or just plain old boredom, these individuals choose to inflict their will on those around them to satisfy some internal need to feel important or that they are making some form of contribution to the human race.  If you evaluate the behavior of those around you carefully, you may have seen it on a smaller scale at your school, your church, or even at your place of employment.  They sometimes present themselves as volunteers.  Many times they may want to assume some leadership role in some activity for no apparent reason.  It always appears to be connected to some shallow desire to "make a difference".  Many times we just shake our heads and ignore it.  But if you keep watching for it, you'll see it on a much grander scale, and this is where it becomes dangerous.  <br><br>
		
		In a journal called BioScience, an article carefully written and endorsed by <a href ="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/70/1/8/5610806">11,000 scientists suggests that population control is a key factor in reducing the amount of green house gases that are fueling the Earth's climate change.</a>  OK, now in English... We need less people on Earth combined with several other corrective actions to save it from climate change destruction.  The article goes on to state that scientists have been meeting since 1979 discussing the dangers of increasing CO2 in the atmosphere, increasing population of the Earth by 80 million people a year, utilization of fossil fuels, and the loss of forests will ultimately result in an uninhabitable planet.... Fear undergirded by their educations and their wealth has lead them to believe that it is their responsibility to inform the uninformed population, oh, that's us... And that they must circle their wagons to save us all....<br><br>
		
		Interesting isn't it?  They're all knowing.  They're economically endowed, and now they want to be all powerful so they can save/control mankind.  But all they have to offer is birth control, planned parenting pamphlets, and vaccines... What else might these saviors do to ensure that the planet is not lost?  After all, it's for the good of the planet and the human race...  And no one else knows any better.  This is why they continuously gather.  So they can remind each other that they know better and they continue to build their plan to save us.  They will save us at any cost... <br><br>
		
		<img src="images/earth.png"/><br><br>
		
		It is as clear as a bell now.  The behavior of these know it alls is a classic manifestation of what has been called a "Zeus Complex".  This idea that the intellectually and economically gifted are above the law.... that they have been ordained to rule, to create, to destroy, and to determine the course of humanity... i.e. who lives and who dies.  They deem themselves above governments... because they are their own government, elected by their degrees and their wallets.  They are Gods! And now, they must act to ensure that mankind continues to exist... <br><br>
		
		Is it possible that throughout history, this Cult of Zeus may be responsible for the unleashing of disease on the people of the Earth?  Is it possible that this Cult of Zeus has fashioned and fueled war between nations as a method of population control?  Is it possible that the Spanish Flu of 1918 and even today's coronavirus were somehow a manufactured ailment inflicted on Earth as a means of population control?  I'm sure no one wants to believe it.  It's absolutely preposterous.  It's absurd.  These accusations are totally unfounded.  And yet, this article outlining the danger of the growing population of the world was released in BioScience Journal Volume 70 Issue 1 on January 2020... Right in the midst of a burgeoning pandemic that No Government would truly acknowledge until March of 2020.  <br><br>
